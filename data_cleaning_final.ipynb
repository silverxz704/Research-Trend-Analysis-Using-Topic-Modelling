       "'International Journal of Standardization Research\\nVolume 19 • Issue 1\\n16but it does not discuss standardization more extensively. This observation further corroborates the \\ncurrently missing link between standardization and economic growth theory.\\nTo summarize, these findings suggest that there is a research gap regarding the association \\nbetween standardization and economic growth. The current paradigm of economic growth theory does not incorporate standardization. Top economics journals published no articles related to the topic between 1996 and 2018. The leading journal in its field, the Journal of Economic Growth, has not yet touched upon standardization, and most researchers on its editorial board have allocated only little attention to standardization. Finally, the concept of standardization is not well-specified and, recently, seems to be more often related to “standardization of tasks.”\\n5.4 Limitations and Avenues for Future Research\\nThe current analysis has several limitations. For instance, it includes only a small portion of leading \\neconomics journals and excludes several journals that have published important articles related to standardization (e.g., Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, The Economic Journal, European Journal of Political Economy). Second, the applied keyword search methodology is not necessarily the most accurate one, and additional robustness checks could be conducted. Finally, the current analysis is just a snapshot of a specific research gap at a specific point in time and thus it becomes obsolete quickly as the literature on standardization continue to grow.\\nInitially, we planned to use the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classifications codes \\nin identifying standardization-related articles (cf. Cherrier, 2017). JEL classification code L15 is “Information and Product Quality: Standardization and Compatibility” and, according to JEL guidelines it “includes studies on standardization and on compatibility, which reduces the problems associated with the information-product-quality nexus.”\\n27 The JEL classification also lists “compatibility,” \\n“standardization,” and “ISO” as keywords belonging to L15. However, the use of JEL classification codes is not always consistent. As an example, whereas Baron and Schmidt (2017) is classified into categories E32, E22, O33, O47, and L15, Blind and Jungmittag (2008) is classified into O41, O52, O11, and E13. There is no overlap despite the fact that both articles analyze the macroeconomic impact of standards. When looking at keywords, there is a similar lack of overlap, but both articles have “standards” or “standardization” as keywords.\\n28 Due to these inconsistencies, this alternative \\nJEL-classification search option is left for future studies and possible replications and updates.\\nAs illustrated in Section 3.2, accumulated economics research and textbooks affect the \\ncurricula of economic growth courses. Future studies could extend the analysis to reviewing the role of standardization in economics courses. Acemoglu (2013) has recommended that economics instructors should spend more time on teaching economic growth at the undergraduate level and also on emphasizing the importance of technology as the key determinant of economic growth. The same growth course could be accompanied by a brief review of standardization so that economics students can acknowledge the importance of standards. There already exist multiple initiatives to increase awareness of the importance of standards (de Vries & Egyedi, 2007; Choi & de Vries, 2011; Blind \\n& Dreschler, 2017).\\nEconomics has shifted over time, increasingly from theoretical modelling to empirical analysis \\n(Hamermesh, 2013). As there are ever-increasing data on standardization available for researchers (e.g., Baron & Spulber, 2018; Baron & Gupta, 2018), it is expected that there will also be more publications on the topic and empirical economists will begin to allocate more attention to standards. Future research could focus on analyzing and quantifying the macro-level economic impact of standards. Evidence-based policies require rigorous empirical analysis and, presumably, the welfare effects of standardization will receive more attention in the future.'"

Introduction \\nThis paper presents Econophysics approach to macroeconomics and develops parallels \\nbetween description of multi particle systems and macroeconomic multi agent systems. \\nSuch approach is well known in Econophysics and there are many applications of \\nmethods of statistical physics, kinetics and hydrodynamics to description of economic \\nsystems [1-8]. As well there exist definite misunderstanding of Econophysics models \\nby economic and financial researchers [9,10]. Indeed fundamental distinctions between \\neconomic and physical systems make direct applications of physical methods for \\neconomic modeling not too effective. Nevertheless certain parallels between economic \\nand physical systems may allow use language of physics to develop economic theory \\non base of pure economic and financial issues.  \\nWe develop model of macroeconomics that is based on pure economic notions with \\nhelp of some parallels between economics and physics. The core issues of our approach \\nconcern introduction of economic space [11-13] that allow describe multi agent \\neconomic systems alike to multi particle systems in physics. For decades international \\nrating agencies estimate risk ratings of corporations and banks. These risk ratings help \\ntake Investment decisions, determine credit policy and avoid losses due to default. We \\npropose that risk assessment methodologies and practice can be developed in such a \\nway that can provide risk ratings for all economic agents of economic and finance \\nsystem. Such “simple” assumption requires tough efforts and development of risk \\nmethodologies and risk econometrics. It requires cooperation of risk agencies and \\nmarket authorities, banking and financial regulators, businesses and Government \\nStatistical Bureaus, academic and business researchers, etc. Let assume that all \\neconometric and regulatory problems can be solved and risk ratings can be provided on \\na regular basis for all economic agents: for huge banks and international corporations \\nand for small companies and households. How that can help for economic modeling? \\nWe propose that risk ratings of economic agents allow establish f irst “parallel” between \\neconomics and physics – introduce coordinates of economic agents [11-13]. Risk \\nratings take values of risk grades that can be treated as points of certain discreet space. \\nLet treat risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on such a space. That \\ndistributes all economic agents by their coordinates and develops parallels to \\ndescription of particles in physics . Let assume that risk assessment methodology can be '"
