“The lack of cooperative standardization in British industry is conspicuous in regard to locomotives. Every considerable railway has its own models, though the materials are to some extent standardized”
Alfred Marshall (1919, p.591)“Standardisation and connection standards may seem purely technical details to the casual observer, 
but in fact they reflect the importance of achieving economies of scale.”
Nathan Rosenberg (1983, p.183)
“Perhaps because these standards are so taken for granted, they are rarely the subject of discussion in circles beyond those in which they are formulated. They are even more rarely the subject of discussion in the public square in democratic institutions of government, or among friends. Indeed, standards are so taken for granted, so mundane, so ubiquitous, that they are extremely difficult to write about. They are usually noticed only when they fail to work.”",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue  ope eative coons aributlicense correspondi author t link betestandardizateconomic groh bib l metric analysis jossi ki  jv l nland  nland timo ali ve has inpennt researcr nland jus is saenokia technologinland t ty no typically tse ey wo rd allocataentbib l metric analysis economic groh standardizatt british every alfred marshall standardisatnatharstenberg haps ty ined ty

Standards can be defined as rules, guidelines, or characteristics established by consensus and 
approved by a recognized body (see ISO/IEC, 2004). According to ISO/IEC (2004), standardization is “the process of development and application of standards” (see Choi et al., 2011). Standards are ubiquitous, and every one of us is exposed to several standards every day (Kindleberger, 1983; Busch, 2011). Consider, for instance, the measurement of time, metric systems, various safety standards, electricity standards, including plugs and sockets, data, image, video and audio compression technologies (codecs), Internet protocols, connectivity of devices via cellular networks, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, etc. Standards have obvious public good characteristics (Kindleberger, 1983; David & Greenstein, 1990; Swann, 2000; Blind & Jungmittag, 2008) and, generally, the promotion of standards is considered beneficial, as reflected, for instance, by the increasing number of national and voluntary standards organizations and their expressed missions. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has more than 164 national standards organizations as members that promote standardization nationally.
1
It has been documented that societies underinvest in R&D (Jones & Williams, 2000; Lucking 
et al., 2018). Much less empirical evidence exists on whether societies under- or overinvest in standardization. According to Rysman and Simcoe (2009, p.1932): “the importance of SSOs has been widely discussed, yet there have been no attempts to systematically measure the effects of these institutions.” Standards can be national, international, or global by their geographical dimension (Swann et al., 1996; Nadvi, 2008; Blind et al., 2018). Scale and network effects are typically greater the more international the scope of a standard is.
2 Standards have played an indispensable role, 
for instance, in creating and maintaining the proper functioning of the European Single Market (Pelkmans, 1987; David & Steinmueller, 1994; EC, 2018; Blind et al., 2018). Economists agree that institutions matter for economic growth (North, 1991; Mokyr, 2002; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). Blind and Jungmittag (2008) noted that “standards can also be interpreted as institutions. Institutional economists postulate a close relationship between institutional development and economic growth.” This is also an important premise of the current article: Standards are important institutions that matter for technological progress, innovation, and, therefore, for economic growth and development.
While there exists a variety of different types of standards, we focus here on standards that are 
a result of open and voluntary standard development or setting and are related to technologies. We also note that the dimension of feedback processes classifies standardization organizations. Their operational mode is either one-shot standard setting or dynamic standard development (Teece, 2018).
3 Economists share the belief that innovations and technological progress are the key drivers of 
economic growth in the long run (Aghion & Howitt, 2009) and, presumably, technology standardization impacts the rate and direction of technological change.
4 While researchers of network economics and 
industrial organization economists have extensively studied standardization (e.g., Farrell & Saloner, 1985; Katz & Shapiro, 1986) and the role of patents in standard development (e.g., Lerner & Tirole, 2015), it appears that economic growth theory is almost silent about the macroeconomic impacts of standardization (e.g., Blind & Jungmittag, 2008; Swann, 2010; Baron & Schmidt, 2017). Consequently, we know much more about the microdynamics than the macrodynamics of standardization.
It is interesting that the macroeconomic impacts of technology standardization have received little 
attention among economists, particularly as standardization organizations have existed for more than a century.
5 Examples of standards that have had a substantial global impact include, among others, 
freight container standards (ISO/TC 104 Freight containers; Levinson, 2006; Bernhofen et al., 2016), Internet standards (IETF, W3C, Simcoe, 2015) and telecommunication standards (ETSI, ITU, Röller & Waverman, 2001; Teece, 2018). These standards have significantly promoted globalization and technological change. The heterogeneous nature of different standards and standardization processes makes it challenging to analyze the aggregate macroeconomic impacts of standardization. Presumably, this is a major factor explaining the dearth of research on the topic. The goal of this article is to shed more light on this research gap and the link between standardization and economic growth.

2.1 Theoretical Link Between Standardization and Economic Growth
The leading researchers of economic growth have analyzed a variety of factors that are associated 
with economic growth.
6 Economists and economic historians share the belief that technological 
progress is the key driver of economic growth in the long run (Solow, 1956; Mokyr, 2002; Aghion & Howitt, 2009). However, often, economists do not dig deeper into the details, or “the black box” (Rosenberg, 1983), of technological progress. Standardization has been discussed and analyzed for more than a century by economists, including Thorstein Veblen (1904) and Alfred Marshall (1919).
7 
As early as 1919, Marshall discussed standardization extensively in his 1919 book, “Industry and Trade,” and emphasized the important role that “multiform standardization” has had in promoting mass production in the U.S. (Langlois, 2001).
8 Yet, the paradigm of economic growth theory seems to 
have neglected the role of standardization in technological progress and in our increasing wellbeing.
To a large extent, the rate and direction of technological change are determined by the allocation 
of R&D investments, and there are several institutions that determine the incentives to invest in R&D (Arrow, 1962; Scotchmer, 2004). As mentioned, the role of institutions as determinants of economic growth has received increasing attention (North, 1990; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). According to North (1991), “institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction.” By this definition, technical standards are also “institutions” (cf. Blind & Jungmittag, 2008; Featherston et al., 2016; Maze, 2017). The key message of new institutional economics is that “institutions matter” for economic growth. From the perspective of technological progress, the institutions that promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge, i.e., “efficient functioning of the knowledge infrastructure” (cf. Edquist, 1997), are the key factors. Standards are an important institution that can promote the diffusion of technologies (Blind & Jungmittag, 2008) and foster competition (Koski & Kretschmer, 2005). Standards promote interoperability, adoption of technologies, and network effects (Matutes & Regibeau, 1996; Shapiro & Varian, 1999; Swann, 2000). Thus, standards also matter for economic growth. First generation endogenous technological change models (Romer, 1990; Grossman & Helpman, 1991; Aghion & Howitt, 1992) added realism to earlier models of economic growth by treating innovation processes as endogenous. Similarly, standardization is an endogenous process that shapes technological progress.
R&D investments create positive externalities, and important progress has been made in the 
analysis of these knowledge spillovers (Lucking et al., 2018). Still, the quantification of externalities remains a great challenge to economists (Jones, 2016). For instance, Jones (2016) notes that there is a need for economic growth researchers to learn more about “the extent of knowledge spillovers across countries” as “each country benefits from knowledge created elsewhere in the world.” Similarly, spillovers from standardization are not easily quantifiable. According to Leiponen (2008): “Opportunities to learn and accumulate social and political capabilities are thus of the essence in the creation of new standards. Firms are advised to engage in a broad cooperative approach if they wish to influence the evolution of standards.” On the other hand, Blind and Mangelsdorf (2016) note: “Significant knowledge flows are apparent within standardization processes, especially from larger to the smaller German companies opposite of that seen in other types of strategic alliances.

4are – as shown in Sherif (2015) for Chinese companies – interactive learning spaces. Consequently, 
companies’ knowledge management, including their open innovation strategies, must take these opportunities into account when considering entrance into standardization.”
A particular type of technology that creates large amounts of positive externalities is a “general 
purpose technology” (GPT). GPTs include electricity, steam, semiconductors, and the Internet (Bresnahan & Trajtenberg, 1995; Simcoe, 2015, p.16).
9 From the economic perspective, standards 
that promote interoperability are also particularly important (cf. Simcoe, 2015), as interoperability promotes efficiency. Standardization of technologies is closely linked to the development of general purpose technologies (Simcoe, 2015, p.26).
10 Standardized technologies, such as cellular connectivity, 
can be viewed as a general purpose technology (Teece, 2018) that enables downstream technological trajectories (Dosi, 1982)
11 in multiple industries (Kim et al., 2017). Standards are a heterogeneous 
set (Tassey, 2000; Simcoe et al., 2009; Wiegmann et al., 2017; Teece, 2018; Baron & Spulber, 2018; Baron et al., 2019), and some “upstream” standards enable a larger variety of downstream products and innovations. Swann (2000) notes: “The ultimate measure of how a standards infrastructure contributes to the economy is the sum of additional innovative products and services (and any attendant cost reductions) that grow on the back of that standards infrastructure.”
Endogenous models of economic growth have incorporated competition and innovation into the 
analysis of economic growth, and researchers have derived stylized facts and predictions that can be explained by these dynamics (Aghion et al., 2015). However, coordination in innovation activity and how this affects the sequence of knowledge accumulation, i.e., direction of innovation, has thus far received less attention. The patent system in itself is a decentralized coordination mechanism that allocates the attention and investments of profit-maximizing agents to research projects that have the highest expected returns (Scotchmer, 2004). The public sector can also affect the rate and direction of technological change by using other “innovation policy instruments” (Takalo, 2013) or “policy toolkits” (Bloom et al., 2019), including, for example, R&D subsidies, R&D tax exemptions, and IPR systems.
Economists highlight the role of the combinatorial growth of ideas and related increasing returns 
(Romer, 1993; Weitzman, 1998; Jones, 2005). However, ideas-based growth cannot be only about increasing the variety of ideas because human attention and resources are limited. In a world where attention and resources are scarce, there needs to be some mechanisms that define which ideas to pursue and, also, in which sequence. The allocation of R&D investments crucially impacts the rate and direction of technological change and technological trajectories. Economic growth researchers often focus on innovation incentives but neglect incentives to create compatible and interoperable products in the value chain.
The abovementioned institutions all affect the rate and direction of technological change, but 
they rely mainly on competition of ideas and products in the market. Standardization, on the other hand, is based on a balance between competition and collaboration (i.e., “coopetition”) where the aim is to achieve consensus (Schmidt & Werle 1998; Egyedi, 2000; Simcoe, 2015). Standardization can be understood as a coordination mechanism (Maze, 2017; Wiegmann et al., 2017) by which economic actors can collaboratively decide the technical specifications for products, etc. (Simcoe, 2015; Wiegmann et al., 2017) based on specific criteria and through either consensus or majority vote (Baron et al., 2019).
12 The focus is not on increasing the variety of ideas but, in contrast, reducing the 
number of ideas and amount of variety. Standardization is, in essence, variety reduction (Farrell & Saloner, 1985; Tassey, 2000). This process leads to focused technological trajectories with reduced market uncertainty (Gaynor, 2001). Sometimes, there are also competing standards (Wiegmann et al., 2017) that can co-exist and compete on the market. It is not hard to see why increasing variety of incompatible or non-interoperable product interfaces is anything but welfare increasing. In the standardization process, decision makers collectively select technical solutions on the basis of a consensus, and there is thus no need for all of the competing standards to enter the market when competition and selection of technical solutions occur within standardization process instead.",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue r  chinese consequently ts internet bresnaharaj teberg since from since standardizatsince standardized te ece dos kim standards as  since wie mante ece baroput ber baroswat endogenous gh t coamer t taka lo bloom economists ror with majonit economic t standardizatschmidt re eg ye di since standardizatmaze wie mansince wie manbarot standardizatbarrel lor as   mayor sometimwie manit in

5Standards can be concurrently defined as either knowledge, ideas, meta-ideas, technology, 
recipes, or institutions. Standardization is a process in which the technical specifications of certain 
aspects of technologies are codified, and thus the standard is codified knowledge. “Idea” is a very broad concept that forms the basic unit of “ideas-based growth” (Romer, 1993; Jones, 2005) and can be defined as “instructions or recipes, things that can be codified in a bitstring as a sequence of ones and zeros” (Jones, 2005). According to Romer (1993), “Perhaps the most important ideas of all are meta-ideas—ideas about how to support the production and transmission of other ideas.”
13 
Standards fit this definition. As already mentioned, standards are also institutions, i.e., rules of the game, as they constrain future technological development by reducing variety (cf. North, 1991). Moreover, the standardization process is a meta-idea or institution, as it is an idea about how to produce efficiently better ideas. Standards are technologies or recipes since they specify how one gets a specific output from a set of inputs (Romer, 1990). In addition, standards can be regarded as “technological trajectories” (Dosi, 1982, 1988; Cozzi, 1997; Kim et al., 2017). By reducing the variety of technologies, standardization promotes the more efficient allocation of resources as economic agents abandon some technological trajectories.
According to Grossman and Helpman (1994), “profit-seeking investments in knowledge play 
a critical role in the long-run growth process.” Knowledge, technology, and innovations are not “manna from heaven” (cf. Audretsch, 2007). Similarly, standards are not manna from heaven. In Romer’s (1990) endogenous growth model, growth “is driven by technological change that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents.” Economic agents require appropriate incentives to invest in standardization activities and adopt standardized technologies. Thus, the observation that companies participate in technology standardization and adopt standardized technologies indicates that companies consider standardization to have positive expected returns.
2.2 Empirical Link Between Standardization and Economic Growth
The importance of standards has increased over the past decades (Lerner & Tirole, 2015), particularly 
in the ICT sector (Shapiro & Varian, 1999; Baron et al., 2019). According to Baron et al. (2019), standardization has long been recognized as playing an important role in technological innovation, the diffusion of new technologies, and economic growth. Therefore, it is expected that standards’ impact on the rate and direction of technological progress and economic growth has similarly increased. Standards are a heterogenous set, as are standard development organizations (SDOs, Wiegmann et al., 2017; Teece, 2018; Baron & Spulber, 2018; Baron et al., 2019). Here, we briefly review whether there is any empirical link between standardization and innovation and technological change.
Schumpeterian growth theory (Aghion et al., 2015) predicts that incumbents do the most R&D. 
Incumbents also do the most standards development, according to empirical evidence (Larouche & Schuett, 2019). Existing empirical evidence on the impact of standards is scant (Blind & Jungmittag, 2008; Rysman & Simcoe, 2008; Baron & Schmidt, 2017). The typical challenge is the lack of data on counterfactual worlds. However, empirical evidence suggests that standardization has important impacts in multiple fields.
14
Whereas a large share of the standardization literature has discussed the possibility that standards 
may lead to a lock-in to inferior technologies (David, 1985; Maze, 2017), empirical evidence suggests that SDOs perform well in selecting important technologies (Rysman & Simcoe, 2008).
15 Kim et al. 
(2017) find that standards are a driving force of technological convergence. Interestingly, it seems that in the economics literature, the potential negative impacts of standards seem to be sometimes more frequently cited than the benefits of standards. The anecdote of the QWERTY keyboard as an inferior de facto standard is a very popular example used to illustrate how path-dependence and standardization can lead to a lock-in to an inefficient equilibrium outcome (David, 1985).
Our understanding of the impacts of standards has expanded over time. While David (1987) 
identified three different purposes of the standards – (1) compatibility or interoperability, (2) minimum quality or safety, and (3) variety reduction - Swann (2010) listed eight: (1) variety reduction, (2) quality ",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue standards standardizatia ror jonjonaccordi ror haps standards as north ostandards ror idos oz kim by accordi gross malp makledge aud re tesimarly iror economic  emical link betestandardizateconomic groh t learner ti role shapi aria baroaccordi barotrefore standards os wie mante ece baroput ber barore schumpeter iagh incumbents la rou c se existi blind ju mit tag ry masince baroschmidt t wreas did maze os ry masince kim interesti t did our w did swan

6and performance, (3) measurement, (4) codified knowledge, (5) compatibility, (6) vision, (7) health 
and safety, and (8) environmental (see also Swann, 2015). For more extensive reviews of the impacts of standards, see Swann (2000, 2010). Network infrastructures particularly require compatibility standards (Farrell & Saloner, 1985). Telecommunication and broadband infrastructures have been found to positively affect economic growth (Röller & Waverman, 2001; Czernich et al., 2011), and telecommunication is an archetypal example of a network industry in which standards have been and continue to be subject to extensive IO analysis (Leiponen, 2008).
An important aspect of standards and standardization is geography. Standards are often classified 
as national, international, or global (Swann et al., 1996; Nadvi, 2008). The geographical dimension affects particularly strongly the scale effects and, in the case of compatibility and interoperability standards, the network effects of standardization. Researchers of economic growth have allocated a significant amount of their attention to country comparisons and cross-country knowledge spillovers. International trade promotes the efficient division of labor, fosters the diffusion of ideas, and causes economic growth (Frankel & Romer, 1999). Empirical evidence suggests that certain standards promote trade (Swann et al., 1996; Levinson, 2006; Bernhofen et al., 2016). Standardization increases the size of the markets and promotes economies of scale by enabling compatibility. When standards are national and differ across countries, domestic companies may face entry barriers to foreign markets due to incompatible standards. International standardization promotes, therefore, international competition, and competition puts pressure on companies to innovate. Table 1 summarizes the economic impacts of standards discussed in prior literature.
To summarize, standards are ubiquitous and their economic impact is mainly positive according to 
existing empirical studies. The extensive use, support, and development of standards that we observe in practice signal that standards are welfare increasing and economic growth promoting. The research question of this article is, thus, what is the role of technology standardization in leading economics journals and particularly in economic growth theory? Do leading economic growth researchers acknowledge the link between standardization and economic growth? Do books on economic growth discuss standardization? In the next section, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing these questions.
3 ALL oCATI oN oF ATTENTI oN IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AN d EdUCATI oN
Why do certain research topics receive significant attention while others receive negligible attention 
or no attention at all? Which factors determine the set of research trajectories that we observe, and which factors determine the division of labor across scientists and the distribution of attention over the (in)finite set of research topics? How does the famous “invisible hand” generate, via a decentralized process, an equilibrium of supply and demand of scientific knowledge and enable self-interested researchers to produce scientific knowledge that meets the needs of society?
16 In this section, we 
present a simple framework to analyze the allocation of attention among researchers.17 We move from 
general scientific progress to the specificities of economics.
3.1 General Framework
Science is a social institution, and researchers who produce scientific knowledge are, of course, 
also human beings possessing human limitations, interests, and intrinsic and extrinsic motives18 
(Goldman & Shaked, 1991; Leonard, 2002). The attention of scientists is a scarce resource and a coordination device in the production of scientific knowledge and in the development of new ideas (Klamer & van Dalen, 2001; Simcoe & Waguespack, 2011). Hence, the allocation or distribution of attention is typically skewed (Klamer & van Dalen, 2001): Some pieces of knowledge attract more cumulative attention than others. Researchers are necessarily boundedly rational decision makers, as their time and capacity to review all the existing scientific literature are limited. As a consequence, ",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue swafor swanetwork barrel lor telecounicatwater macz erile ip one astandards swanad vi t researcrs internatnal ranked ror emical swalevinsoberof estandardizatwinternatnal table to t t do do ied w whihow i genl framework science goldmashake leonard t later dale since age pack nce later dale some researcrs as

According to Klamer and van Dalen (2001), researchers tend to cluster with likeminded 
researchers. There exists empirical evidence that status helps draw critical attention to a new idea (Merton, 1968; Simcoe & Waguespack, 2011). This “Matthew effect” may lead to herding and the path-dependent accumulation of scientific knowledge (Merton, 1968). There are also pecuniary rewards to received attention, and studies report a positive association between citations and salary (see Hamermesh, 2018, Table 8 for a summary).
Technological progress and standard development, as well as scientific progress and allocation of 
attention among researchers, are endogenous processes - that is, they are defined “within the system.” The dynamics of these processes could be analyzed using rational choice theory, as would any other decision-making situation in which an optimizing decision maker with certain preferences makes choices (cf. Diamond, 1988; Brock & Durlauf, 1999). Suppose there is a finite set of researchers, an infinite set of research topics, and finite time. Researchers aim to produce scientific knowledge and compete for priority (Dasgupta & David, 1994; Strevens, 2013). Researchers’ “return” would thus be conditional on being the first to create new ideas and new research results. Thus, the optimization problem faced by a researcher at a specific point in time could be characterized as a choice of distributing attention and research effort over a menu of research topics that maximizes expected utility over the researcher’s career given her or his preferences, existing scientific knowledge, institutions, and beliefs over the choices of other researchers.
Irrespective of the exact form of researchers’ heterogenous objective functions, preferences, 
and incentive systems, it is clear that researchers face tradeoffs and must make choices about how to allocate their scarce attention during the finite time that they have. The limited attention of academic researchers is necessarily focused on a specific set of topics during the finite research career.

Researchers must prioritize given their preferences over the set of possible research topics and also concurrently take into account and have beliefs and second-order beliefs about the choices of other Table 1. Economic impacts of standards, examples

8competing researchers. The outcome of these correlated research topic choices and allocation of 
attention is a set of research paradigms and trajectories that we observe. In other words, the observed research outputs reveal researchers’ preferences and beliefs about what they have considered important and worth researching.
20 These choices may have path-dependent consequences on the careers of 
researchers (cf. Jensen, 2013).
Weitzman (1998) notes that several authors have argued that invention or discovery in any 
sector takes place by combining ideas. Since science is cumulative by nature, there is a tendency of path-dependence and lock-in on specific topics, theories, and/or methodological choices (Akerlof, 2019). Researchers stand on the shoulders of giants and build their studies on prior existing studies and research trajectories (Kuhn, 1962; Furman & Stern, 2006). Kuhn (1962) highlighted the role of books in establishing research paradigms. He writes that “textbooks expound the body of accepted theory, illustrate many or all of its successful applications, and compare these applications with exemplary observations and experiments”, and that “from textbooks each new scientific generation learns to practice its trade” (p.10). The content of textbooks and existing research articles have an impact on the framing of certain topics. Figure 1 illustrates that researchers stand on the shoulders of giants and that the existing knowledge stock defines the research topics and syllabi of courses based on prior research.
Notes: Authors’ illustration.Systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses can reveal research gaps or under-researched topics. 
Romer (1990) describes ideas as recipes that can be combined, and Weitzman (1998) formalized an idea-based growth model by “introducing a production function for new knowledge that depends on new recombinations of old knowledge” (see also Olsson, 2000, 2005). Research gaps can be understood as combinations of ideas that have not yet been investigated in the existing literature. Researchers have not even considered these idea combinations, or they have considered them but have instead allocated their limited attention to different, more promising topics or combinations of ideas.Figure 1.

93.2 Economics Framework
Which factors determine the set of research trajectories that we observe in the field of economics? 
How do researchers choose their research topics in the field of economics? Which research articles 
are accepted by editors to be published in leading economics journals? The sociology of economics 
research that focuses on these types of questions has a long tradition (e.g., Samuelson, 1962; Stigler 
& Friedman, 1975; Colander, 1989; Coupé, 2004; Hamermesh, 2018).
Empirical evidence indicates that publications and citations matter for labor market outcomes and 
for the salaries of economists (Coupé, 2004; Hamermesh, 2018). Therefore, economists as economic agents may focus on topics that fit well into the orthodox views of the research community and are therefore easier to publish in journals (cf. Brock & Durlauf, 1999; Akerlof, 2019; Heckman & Moktan, 2019). There can be a conflict between societal preferences and the individual preferences of economics researchers in the allocation of researchers’ attention (i.e., allocative inefficiency). Even if the society might benefit from increased useful knowledge in one topic, economics researchers might still choose to focus on another topic.
Moreover, it has been documented that most novel and innovative ideas may face harsh resistance 
before they are accepted (Gans & Shephard, 1994), and there exists evidence of bias against novelty in science (Wang et al., 2017; Akerlof, 2019). For instance, W. Brian Arthur’s seminal article (1989) was published only after multiple rejections by leading economics journals over a six-year period (Gans & Shephard, 1994). Sometimes, important new ideas are only discovered years after they are published.
21
Hodgson and Rothman (1999), among others, have documented the dominance of a few U.S. 
institutions in published journal articles and journals’ editorial boards. They raise the concern that such “institutional and geographical concentration of editors and authors may be unhealthy for innovative research in economics.” Similarly, Coupé (2003) reports that U.S. universities and American economists dominated in the production of economics literature during 1990-2000, although the extent of their dominance did decrease over this period. Drèze and Estevan (2007, see Table 11) provide further evidence of this U.S.-oriented concentration by reporting that authors based in U.S. institutions dominate publishing in top economics journals. According to Frey and Eichenberger (1993), American economists tend to specialize in theory but neglect local institutions, whereas European economists are theoretically broad and institutionally specialized. Institutional differences between U.S. and Europe can play a role in the context of standardization research.
Presumably, researchers who focus on the theory of economic growth are no different from 
other researchers. Also, they build their new ideas and theories by combining ideas generated by past economic growth theory researchers. In the context of economic growth theory (and economics more generally), recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Robert Solow and Paul Romer, among others, could be described as “giants” upon whose shoulders current and future growth theorists stand. The high number of forward citations received by their research articles is a clear indication of this (see Table 4).
As the curricula of economics courses themselves comprise an institution that directs the attention 
of economics students, it is important to analyze their content. A conscious or unconscious choice to leave some important topics, such as the economic impact of standards, out of economics curricula is likely to have certain outcomes. Students probably less often write their theses about those topics that are not discussed in their courses. The process is endogenous and incremental: Economics students become experts mainly in the fields in which they receive their education.
To our knowledge, there are no bibliometric analyses on how economists have allocated their 
attention to standardization and particularly on the role of standardization in the context of economic growth. Narayanan and Chen (2012) summarized the primary research streams and key arguments of technology standards research but did not focus on the perspectives of economics literature. They concluded that “the greatest opportunity lies in integrative works that will take us one step closer to a comprehensive view of technology standards.” Choi et al.

there were 13 published articles focusing on these topics; in 2008, there were 68 articles on these topics (altogether, 528 articles in Web of Science). Choi et al. (2011) identified six subject-group domains of management, economics, environment, chemistry, computer science, and telecommunications, and suggested that future studies could more deeply analyze the details of these subject-group domains. This article focuses on the economics domain and seeks to offer one integrative view by analyzing the link between standardization and economic growth.
4 METH odo LoGy ANd dATA
In order to analyze the attention allocated to the link between standardization and economic growth 
in the economics literature, we conduct a bibliometric analysis that uses a variety of different search techniques and methods. The analysis is purely descriptive and comprises three sections: (1) Standardization in leading economics journals, (2) Standardization in the peer-reviewed articles of leading researchers of economic growth, and (3) Standardization in a set of economic growth-related books. Scientific articles and books comprise the core of the knowledge base that impacts the allocation of attention by future researchers and teachers (see Figure 1). In the following sections, we transparently explain the data-gathering process in detail so that other researchers can replicate the analyses in the future.
4.1 Articles in Leading Economics Journals
Leading academic journals in economics enjoy authoritative positions. Following prior studies 
(e.g., Kalaitzidakis et al., 2003; Heckman & Moktan, 2018; Hamermesh 2013, 2018), we focus on the so-called “top5” economics journals: American Economic Review (AER), Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), Econometrica, Journal of Political Economy (JPE), and Review of Economic Studies (RES). It is justifiable to say that they form “the core” of the scientific knowledge stock in economics. The majority of the most cited economics papers have been published in these journals.
22 
Heckman and Moktan (2018) report that the top5 publications “have a powerful influence on tenure decisions and rates of transition to tenure,” and that the “pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists.” They also show, using a survey, that the perceptions of young economists are consistent with this view.
Furthermore, several of the most important articles in the field of economic growth have been 
published in top5 journals. These include Romer (1990), published in JPE; Solow (1956), published in QJE; Grossman and Helpman (1991) and Acemoglu (2002), published in REStud; Aghion & Howitt (1992), published in Econometrica; and Kuznets (1955) and Nelson and Phelps (1966), published in AER. Of these authors Kuznets, Solow, Phelps, and Romer received Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences, in 1971, 1987, 2006, and 2018, respectively.
As we focus on analyzing the association between standardization and economic growth, we 
add the Journal of Economic Growth to complement top5 journals in the sample of economics journals. The Journal of Economic Growth is the leading special journal in the field. Here, the unit of observation is an article in the sample of the mentioned leading economics journals. The search query that we apply in the Scopus database is ALL(“standardization” OR “standardisation”) AND ALL(technology OR technologies OR technological OR technical) AND ALL(“economic growth”).
4.2 Articles by Leading Researchers of Economic Growth
Leading researchers of economic growth are the key decision makers who make important choices 
about how the paradigms and trajectories of economic growth research evolve over time (cf. Figure 1). Their allocation of attention directs, in a path-dependent manner, the attention of other researchers.
We analyze whether leading researchers of economic growth have studied the link between

11define the leading researchers of economic growth. We limited the sample to editors of Journal of 
Economic Growth (as of June 2019), which is one of the leading journals in the field, and which has been published since 1996. Its editorial board includes Paul Romer and Paul Krugman, both recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. In addition, most of the editors have written articles to the “Handbook of Economic Growth,” which was also edited by Philippe Aghion and Steven Durlauf, editors of the Journal of Economic Growth. There were 34 editors as of June 2019, and Scopus found 2212 documents (incl. articles and books) published by them as of 14 August 2019. The number of documents is biased downward as the Scopus database does not include all older articles (pre-1996). In order to identify documents that focus on standardization and economic growth, we conducted keyword searches in the Scopus database for each author’s documents separately using the following search query: ALL(“standardization” OR “standardisation”) AND ALL(technology OR technologies OR technological OR technical) AND ALL(“economic growth”). Each author had on average 65 publications (median: 53) in the Scopus database. Thus, the unit of observation here is an article written by an editor of the Journal of Economic Growth.
4.3 Books Related to Economic Growth
Although books are not the major vehicle of scholarly communication in economics (Hamermesh, 
2018), they are still often used in teaching as textbooks. Presumably, books on economic growth are an important knowledge source for students of economic growth (cf. Figure 1) since they are often used as coursebooks and enter the syllabi of university courses that focus on economic growth theory.
23 
Books may therefore frame the thinking of future economic growth researchers (cf. Kuhn, 1962).
We limit our attention to books published by editors of the Journal of Economic Growth. We 
inquired whether “standardization” or “standards” occurred in their indexes. The unit of observation is an index of an economic-growth-related book written by an editor of the Journal of Economic Growth.
5 FIN dINGS
5.1 Top Economics Journals
Table 2 reports the numbers of articles published in the leading economics journals that are captured 
using the specific search terms. The table indicates that there are only a few articles published in top5 journals related to standardization and economic growth. Table 3 lists the articles that are found using the search terms in column 3 of Table 2.
A manual check of the articles in Table 3 reveals that they in fact do not focus on standardization 
in the sense discussed in this article (i.e., standards development). Articles by Adserà and Ray (1998) and Sákovics and Steiner (2012) are captured by the keyword search because they cite Farrell and Saloner’s (1985) article, which has the word “standardization” in its title, instead of actually analyzing the association between standardization and economic growth. Similarly, Acemoglu (2007) cites Farrell and Saloner (1985) but mentions “standardization” also on page 1378 in a footnote: “I assume that the research firm can only choose one technology, which might be, for example, because of the necessity of standardization across firms.” Also, Jovanovic and Rousseau (2014) does not focus on standards 
development, although they write on page 864, “Our distinction between extensive investment in new projects and intensive investment in continuing projects is related to one made by Acemoglu, Gancia, and Zilibotti 2012 between innovation and standardization costs.” Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) 
have a labor economics perspective on standardization, as they focus on “standardization of tasks” instead of product standardization and standards development. Finally, Acemoglu et al. (2018) is captured because it refers to Acemoglu et al. (2012), which has the word “standardization” in its title.
To summarize, we did not find one single article published in top5 economics journals that 
analyses the link between standardization and economic growth.

13of labor economics, the concept of standardization is more related to “standardization of tasks” (e.g., 
Acemoglu et al., 2012, 2018) than product or system standardization or technical specifications.
5.2 Leading Researchers of Economic Growth
As of August 2019, the Journal of Economic Growth had published no articles that (1) focus on 
technology standardization (see Section 4.1), (2) list “standard,” “standards,” or “standardization” as keywords, or (3) list “L15” as a JEL classification code.
24 Using economics jargon: It seems that 
the existing research on standardization has not been used as an input in the production of economic growth theory. Therefore, we focus in this and the next section on more deeply analyzing the attention allocated to standardization by the editors of the Journal of Economic Growth.
Table 4 reports the number of articles by leading economic growth researchers
25 that mention 
specific keywords related to standardization and economic growth. It is notable that only six out of 34 editors (~18%) are affiliated with European universities, while 26 are affiliated with American universities, and three with an Israeli university.
Table 5 lists the articles that are authored by editors of the Journal of Economic Growth and are 
captured by the specific search terms related to standardization and economic growth presented in Section 4.2. Note that there is a significant overlap between articles in Table 3 and Table 5, as four articles can be found in both tables. Notably, Acemoglu is an author in seven of the 11 identified articles. We explained already above why Adserà and Ray (1998), Acemoglu (2007), Acemoglu (2018), and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) are captured. A closer look at the contents of the seven other articles reveals why the search query captures them. Durlauf (2005) is captured because its reference list includes Farrell and Saloner (1985), and Acemoglu et al. (2015) and Zilibotti (2017) are captured because they cite Acemoglu et al. (2012). Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012) is captured as it cites Acemoglu et al. (2012) in footnote 7, and Acemoglu (2012) is an introduction to the special issue of the Journal of Economic Theory which includes and introduces Acemoglu et al. (2012). Acemoglu et al. (2012) focuses on standardization but from a slightly differing theoretical “labor economics” perspective. In other words, Aghion et al. (2009) is the only article by an editor of the Journal of Economic Growth that actually discusses standardization from the perspective of this article. Interestingly, their perspective on standardization seems to be relatively negative, as they write (p.689): “In network industries, and in product markets characterized by network externality effects, a policy stance of avoiding deliberate standard-setting is not a strategy sufficient to prevent regrettable standardization  outcomes, in which industries are ‘locked in’ to an inferior technical system 
that proves costly to abandon.” They also highlight on page 689 that “Perhaps the most productive question to ask is how we can identify situations in which, at some future time, most technology users would look back and agree that they would have been better off had they converged on the adoption of an alternative technical option (David, 1987).”
5.3 Books Related to Economic Growth
Table 6 shows that most economic growth theory textbooks do not mention “standardization” in their 
indexes. Most prominently, the authoritative “Handbook of Economic Growth” (Aghion & Durlauf, 2006, 2014) is among that majority. Yet, a few exceptions are found. David Weil (2012) mentions standards briefly but focuses on government-imposed standards on page 305:
“Excessive standards – Governments impose standards on all sorts of goods that are sold in their 
countries, ranging from regulations designed to protect public health (e.g., pure-food standards) to requirements that enable different pieces of equipment to work together. Often, however, standards are used to keep foreign products out of the market. For example, Israel, with a population of only 6 million, requires the use of an electrical plug that is unique in the world, to give an advantage to local manufacturers of electrical equipment.”",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue cem og lu leadi researcrs economic groh as august journal economic groh seusi it trefore journal economic groh table it aisraeli table journal economic groh senote table table notably cem og lu  ad ser ray cem og lu cem og lu cem og lu restrepo url auf barrel lor cem og lu zi li bot ti cem og lu cem og lu ak c it cem og lu cem og lu journal economic tory cem og lu cem og lu h journal economic groh interesti ity haps did books related economic groh table most handbook economic groh gh url auf yet did ll excessive governments oftefor israel

15Mokyr (2002) mentions “standardization” a few times, for instance, on page 111:
“Modularization was closely related to standardization, making all products of particular type 
conform to a uniform standard. Standardization, much like modularization, helped not just during the production stage of output but also in the maintenance of durable equipment. Whoever could repair one Model T could repair any Model T.” 
These observations suggest that standardization plays no focal role in economic growth books. 
This indicates that researchers of economic growth do not generally consider standardization to be an important factor affecting technological progress and economic growth.
A comprehensive keyword search within the content of these books is left for future research. 
However, we conducted a keyword search using the search term “standardization” among the articles that are included in volumes 1 and 2 of the Handbook of Economic Growth (Aghion & Durlauf, 2006, 2014). The “Handbook of Economic Growth” which is edited by world-leading researchers of economic growth, could be considered to represent the stage of the current scientific paradigm. We found one article that included the word “standardization”: Ventura (2005) mentions “Advances in telecommunications technology and the standardization of software allow producers around the world to combine physical and human capital located in different regions in a single production process,” Table 5.

16but it does not discuss standardization more extensively. This observation further corroborates the 
currently missing link between standardization and economic growth theory.
To summarize, these findings suggest that there is a research gap regarding the association 
between standardization and economic growth. The current paradigm of economic growth theory does not incorporate standardization. Top economics journals published no articles related to the topic between 1996 and 2018. The leading journal in its field, the Journal of Economic Growth, has not yet touched upon standardization, and most researchers on its editorial board have allocated only little attention to standardization. Finally, the concept of standardization is not well-specified and, recently, seems to be more often related to “standardization of tasks.”
5.4 Limitations and Avenues for Future Research
The current analysis has several limitations. For instance, it includes only a small portion of leading 
economics journals and excludes several journals that have published important articles related to standardization (e.g., Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, The Economic Journal, European Journal of Political Economy). Second, the applied keyword search methodology is not necessarily the most accurate one, and additional robustness checks could be conducted. Finally, the current analysis is just a snapshot of a specific research gap at a specific point in time and thus it becomes obsolete quickly as the literature on standardization continue to grow.
Initially, we planned to use the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classifications codes 
in identifying standardization-related articles (cf. Cherrier, 2017). JEL classification code L15 is “Information and Product Quality: Standardization and Compatibility” and, according to JEL guidelines it “includes studies on standardization and on compatibility, which reduces the problems associated with the information-product-quality nexus.”
27 The JEL classification also lists “compatibility,” 
“standardization,” and “ISO” as keywords belonging to L15. However, the use of JEL classification codes is not always consistent. As an example, whereas Baron and Schmidt (2017) is classified into categories E32, E22, O33, O47, and L15, Blind and Jungmittag (2008) is classified into O41, O52, O11, and E13. There is no overlap despite the fact that both articles analyze the macroeconomic impact of standards. When looking at keywords, there is a similar lack of overlap, but both articles have “standards” or “standardization” as keywords.
28 Due to these inconsistencies, this alternative 
JEL-classification search option is left for future studies and possible replications and updates.
As illustrated in Section 3.2, accumulated economics research and textbooks affect the 
curricula of economic growth courses. Future studies could extend the analysis to reviewing the role of standardization in economics courses. Acemoglu (2013) has recommended that economics instructors should spend more time on teaching economic growth at the undergraduate level and also on emphasizing the importance of technology as the key determinant of economic growth. The same growth course could be accompanied by a brief review of standardization so that economics students can acknowledge the importance of standards. There already exist multiple initiatives to increase awareness of the importance of standards (de Vries & Egyedi, 2007; Choi & de Vries, 2011; Blind 
& Dreschler, 2017).
Economics has shifted over time, increasingly from theoretical modelling to empirical analysis 
(Hamermesh, 2013). As there are ever-increasing data on standardization available for researchers (e.g., Baron & Spulber, 2018; Baron & Gupta, 2018), it is expected that there will also be more publications on the topic and empirical economists will begin to allocate more attention to standards. Future research could focus on analyzing and quantifying the macro-level economic impact of standards. Evidence-based policies require rigorous empirical analysis and, presumably, the welfare effects of standardization will receive more attention in the future.",2022-01-22T20:28:33Z,internatnal journal standardizatresearvolume issue  to t tt journal economic groh nally limitatns enufuture researt for journal economics management strategy t economic journal ajournal political economy second nally initially journal economic re cr rie informatprodu quality standardizatatibity t as baroschmidt blind ju mit tag tre wdue as sefuture cem og lu t tre trieg ye di choi triblind dr esc hler economics haer mesh as baroput ber barogupta future evince

186 CoNCLU dING REMARKS
The main findings of this article are the following. No article has analyzed the link between 
standardization and economic growth in top5 economics journals and the Journal of Economic Growth. A representative sample of leading researchers of economic growth has allocated only negligible attention to the link between standardization and economic growth. Economic growth theory textbooks and closely related books only occasionally mention standardization. Based on these findings, it is plausible to conclude that the current paradigm of economic growth theory neglects standardization. We confirm the observation that there are very few academic studies in the field of economics that analyze the contribution of standardization to economic growth (Blind et al., 2005; Blind & Jungmittag, 2008; Baron & Schmidt, 2017).
Existing empirical evidence suggests that standards may have significant economic impacts. 
Yet, the role of standardization as a factor in economic growth and development has, thus far, been neglected. These observations indicate that mainstream economic growth researchers have not considered standardization to be an important determinant of economic growth and prosperity. This lack of attention may have significant implications. Since university teaching is research-based, with the limited accumulated research on the role of standards in technological change there exists a risk that standardization will receive little attention in the future as well. Standards matter for technological progress, productivity, and economic growth. Economic growth researchers could further shed light on the black box of technological progress by allocating more attention to standardization.

researchers' articles, and economic growth-related books. We make the following
observations: 1) No article has analyzed the link between standardization and
economic growth in top5 economics journals between 1996 and 2018. 2) A
representative sample of the leading researchers of economic growth has
allocated little attention to the link between standardization and economic
growth. 3) Typically, economic growth textbooks do not contain ""standards"" or
""standardization"" in their word indexes. These findings suggest that the
economic growth theory has neglected the role of standardization.

2  Although some national standards organizations are also very important.
3  One way to describe the difference is to note that standard setting and development constitute a competition 
between standards and within standards, respectively.
4  Technological progress and technological change are used interchangeably throughout the paper. We do not use the term “technical change.”
5  The British Standards Institute, BSI, was the world’s first National Standards Body, formed in 1901. The German Institute for Standardization, DIN, was founded in 1917, and the American National Standards Institute, ANSI, was founded in 1918.
6  Akcigit (2017) provides an overview of the past, present, and future of economic growth theory, and Jones (2016) an overview of the facts. Chu (2018) provides an overview of economic growth teaching curricula. A glimpse into the most recent version of the “Handbook of Economic Growth” provides an overview of the growth factors to which growth researchers have recently allocated their attention (Aghion et al., 2014).
7  David and Greenstein (1990) provides an overview.
8  See also Veblen (1904) for early contributions on the “economics of standardization” field.
9  Standardized written and spoken languages can also be considered as the ultimate “GPTs.” Mokyr (2002, p. 58) notes: “For communication between individuals to occur, a common terminology is essential. Language is the ultimate general purpose technology, to use Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1993) well-known term. It provides the technology that creates others.” As a more recent example of language standardization: Emojis, special pictorial symbols, are standardized by Unicode Emoji Subcommittee.
10  “If one views the Internet as a general purpose technology, these standard-setting organizations may provide a forum where GPT-producers can interact with application-sector innovators in an effort to internalize the vertical (from GPT to application) and horizontal (among applications) externalities implied by complementarities in innovation across sectors, as modeled in Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995).” (Simcoe 2015, p.26).
11  Dosi (1982) defines “technological paradigm” as procedures, definitions of the “‘relevant” problems, and as the specific knowledge related to their solution, and “technological trajectory” as the direction of advance within a technological paradigm.
12  For instance, regarding the standardization of the Internet, Simcoe notes that ”Consensus standardization within SSOs (specifically IETF and W3C, as described below) is arguably the dominant mode of coordinating the design decisions and the supply of new interfaces on the modern Internet” (2015 p.26).

14  Quantification is challenging, and existing country comparisons rely on a “stock of standards” proxy variable when analyzing the association between standards and economic growth (e.g., Blind & Jungmittag, 2008).
15  Rysman and Simcoe (2008): “The large difference in baseline citation rates suggests that SSOs perform well in selecting important technologies. If we are willing to place a causal interpretation on the disclosure effect, these results also imply that SSOs increase the significance of standardized technology through formal endorsement and other efforts to promote industry coordination.”
16  According to Leonard (2002): “Scientific rules, and the means for their enforcement, constitute the invisible-hand mechanism, so that scientific rules (sometimes) induce interested scientific actors with worldly goals to make epistemically good choices.”

Accuracy of economic theories and efficiency of economic polic y strictly depend on the

factors responsible for economic dynamics. We consider numerous unnoted economic 
variables and overlooked economic processes those determine the states and predictions of 
the real economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective transactions and 
expectations, mean risks of economic variables and transactions, collective velocities and 
flows of economic variables, transactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic 
evolution. We introduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed 
influence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We introduce 
economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and outline that the bounds 
of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent cyclical motion of collective variables,

"," 2 1. Introduction 
Aspirations to find “correct ” economic theory that should describe and predict markets 
growth, price change, economic development, employment demand and etc., etc., result 
endless economic research. The similar aspirations call for “genuine ” economic policy that 
could solve all problems, improve all economic failures and give birth for economic 
prosperity. Both tied – the economic policy is verified by economic theory and the economic 
theory is permanently adjusted by economic policy. What is the possible origin of both 
endless failures? 
Early economic studies (Cantillon, 1755; Cournot, 1838; Clark, 1915) look absolutely 
contemporary and discuss the same issues and problems that are considered by modern 
researchers. “The Price and Intrinsic Value of a Thing; The Circulation and Exchange of 
Goods and Merchandise ; Production carried on by Entrepreneurs at a risk; Money and 
Interest; Market Prices; The Circulation of Money; International Trade and Business Cycles; 
Banks and their Credit ” – these are the Chapters of Cantillon (1755) written 265 years ago . 
“On the Law of Demand; On the Influence of Taxation on Commodities; On the Competition 
of Producers; On the Communication of Markets ” – are the Chapters of Cournot (1838). 
“Wealth and its Origin; Wages; The Law of Interest; Economic Dynamics ” – are the 
Chapters of “Essentials Of Economic Theory ” by Clark (1915). Since then, studies of 
economic and financial theory move far ahead (Keynes, 1936; Burns, 1954; Blaug, 1985; 
Dimson and Mussavian, 1999; Vines and Wills, 2018), but the catalog of economic subjects 
and the list of economic and financial variables under consideration remain almost the same. 
For sure contribution to the development of the economic and financial theory was made by 
numerous contemporary researches (Muth, 1961; Sharpe, 1964; Lucas, 1972; Leontief, 1973; 
Diebold, 1998; Campbell, 2000; Cochrane, 2001; Wickens, 2008; Shubik, 2011; Hansen, 
2013). The list of references for sure doesn ’t include many researchers but serves as 
illustration of great progress in economic and financial theories during last decades. 
The main subject of almost all economic theories concern investigation and modelling factors 
those impact evolution of few economic and financial variables: asset prices, economic 
growth, investment, business cycles, inflation and employment, economic risks and 
uncertainty, demand and supply relations and so on. Most economic policies pretend solve 
the same economic problems as well as all other, but quickly, chop-chop, before the next 
election time term (Blinder, 2019). Economic problems are really tough and allow various 
treatments and numerous solutions. However, above important economic problems don ’t ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,introduasatns t both what  catlocour not ark t price intrinsic value thi t circulatexe goods merdise produentrepreneurs money interest market pri circulatmoney internatnal tra business cybanks edit chapters catloolaw mand oinfluence taxatcooditioetitproducers ocounicatmarkets chapters cour not alth oriwagt law interest economic dynamics chapters essentials of economic tory ark since eyburns blah diomuss iavinwls for math share lucas leotie die bold campbell cochrane wick ens sh ubi hanset t most blind economic ver

"," 3 deplete the questions, cases and issues that should be studied to make economic theory and 
policy more consistent with economic reality.  
We propose that one of the reasons of the long-term failure of economic theories and policies 
may be explained by the gap between the manifold of properties and processes that conduct 
real economics and the “short ” list of economic variables and relations described by current 
economic models. Indeed, there are almost no chances to reach the ambition to model, 
forecast and mange real economics if one considers and uses only 2-3% of existing ec onomic 
parameters and processes.  
We believe that it is reasonable consider general relations and issues that arise in real 
economics without hasty attempts select “key” economic variables and then derive their 
impact on economic notions of particular interest. Even politicians know that “key” issue 
today could be useless tomorrow. Thus excess attention of researchers to “key” economic 
properties and relations only has not much sense. We propose assess the list of economic 
variables and properties those describe economic evolution and study their general mutual 
relations. The number of economic and financial variables under consideration is enormous 
and many types and classes of economic variables and parameters elude attention of 
researchers, business and politicians. Such omissions cause wrong economic predictions, 
false investor ’s expectations and mistaken economic policy followed by great financial losses 
of entire economy. 
In our paper we consider economic and financial variables and processes on equal basis 
without selection “key” or “significant ” variables. We regard unnoticed economic parameters 
that are responsible for description of economic dynamics and uncertainty. Both are of great 
importance and we don ’t waste time explaining why. 
Macroeconomic dynamics is determined by change of macroeconomic variables. It is of gre at 
importance to study the economic origin of factors those form and change macroeconomic 
variables. Econometrics provides perfect methods for assessment of the macroeconomic 
variables ( Fox, et al. 2017). However, considerations of the processes those govern 
composition of the macroeconomic variables may deliver many surprises. Current ly one 
considers economic variables of separate agents, particular industry and variables that 
describe macroeconomics as a whole, like investment and credits, supply and demand of the 
entire economy. However we believe that definitions of economic variables should reflec t 
certain economic approximation. In this paper we propose definitions of economic variables 
those depend on the choice of numeric scales. It is impossible “exactly ” describe real 
economy. Each economic theory and model should provide certain approximation, ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z, ined  eve  t sui both maoeconomic it econometrics fox current iit each

"," 4 simplification of the real economy. We argue why and how economic variables and processes 
determined by different numeric scales describe approximations of the economic evolution. 
Economics is a system with strong internal ties. Dynamics of the economic variables depend 
on economic uncertainty. Roots of economic uncertainty and ties with uncertainty of 
financial markets and market trade stochasticity establish complex puz zle that worth 
investigation. We consider the roots of economic uncertainty and uncover overlooked 
relations between uncertainty of financial markets and macroeconomic uncertainty. To 
explain these relations we complement the existing economic variables by additional sets of 
unnoticed variables and processes those describe uncertainty of financial markets and 
economic uncertainty as a whole. 
In the next section we consider the nature of economic variables. Economic agents perform 
all economic transactions under action of different risks. We propose replace current letter 
notations of risk grades by numeric continuous risk grades. We take that risk grades of n risks 
fill unit cube [0,1]n in Rn and call it economic domain. We introduce economic continuous 
media approximation in economic domain and describe collective economic variables as 
functions of risk coordinates. Transition from letter risk grades to numeric continuous risk 
grades uncovers unnoticed motions of economic agents in economic domain that generate 
flows of economic variables. In Sec. 3 we consider description of collective market trades 
and collective agents expectations and their flows in economic domain. We demonstrate that 
unnoticed flows of collective economic variables and market trades in bounded economic 
domain [0,1]n in Rn give origin of oscillations those usually notated as business cycles. In 
Sec.4 we consider market roots of economic uncertainty and introduce new market-based 
probability of the market price. Conclusion - in Sec.5. We believe that readers are fami liar 
with modern economic theories, preliminaries of probability theory, partial differential 
equations and etc. We use roman A, B to denote scalars and bold P, υ, x for vector variables. 
2. Economic agents and variables in economic domain 
Any economic theory describes processes and relations those obey approximations 
determined by definite scales. In particular, any economic theory approximates evolution of 
variables and relations between them that are averaged or aggregated during selected time 
interval Δ. For example, economic model can approximately describe variables aggregated 
during interval Δ that equals week, month, quarter, etc. Theory with averaging interval Δ that 
equals 1 month doesn ’t model variations during hour, day or week. However, choice of time 
averaging interval Δ is not sufficient to develop adequate model of real economic processes. ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z, economics dynamics roots  to ieconomic   r transitisec  risec conussec   economic any ifor tory ver

"," 5 One should consider at least one more scale – “space ” scale that determines aggregation of 
economic agents and their variables by “space ” parameter. 
Actually, common treatment of the economic variables those describe industry sectors is 
based on aggregation of variables, like energy consumption, investment, labor etc., of 
economic agents those belong to particular industry ( Fox, et.al., 2017). Variables those 
describe entire economy are composed by aggregation of all economic agents. Economic 
parameters also can be formed by aggregation of agent ’s variables those belong to similar age 
range, wealth level, gender, geographical position and etc. All these cases consider economic 
agents as initial bricks for definition of economic variables. Economic agents are distributed 
by parameters like industries, age, wealth, gender and etc. We would like attract attention to 
other parameters that are in use for decades. Indeed, during at least four decades major risk 
rating companies (S&P, 2014; Fitch, 2018; Moody ’s, 2018) assess credit risk rating of large 
international banks and distribute banks by their risk grades. Each rating agency utilizes its 
own risk rating methodology and uses own risk grade system. Risk grades are noted by letters 
like: AAA, AA, BB , and etc. and list of risk grades may have 30-40 different letter notations.  
Moreover, rating agencies assess transition probabilities. Rating agencies assess probabilities 
that during selected time term (6 months, 1 year, etc.) credit rating of the particular bank can 
change from the current value to a different one and become more secure or more risky (Metz 
Cantor, 2007; Moody ’s, 2009; Fitch, 2017; S&P, 2018). Simply speaking, risk transition 
matrices describe probable motion of economic agents – large international banks – from one 
risk grade to another during the selected time term.  
Above examples confirm that attributing economic agents by parameters like: particular 
sector of economy, age or wealth range, geographical position or risk rating – is a well-
known conventional tool of business and economic research for decades. Attributing agents 
by parameters allow aggregate economic agents by different ranges of these pa rameters and 
develop different approximations of economic evolution.  
However, agent ’s parameters mentioned above have certain common flaw. Indeed, their 
usage doesn ’t allow enjoy benefits those can be achieved by description of economic agents 
and their variables by parameters or coordinates of some metric space that reflects properties 
of macroeconomics. We believe that usage of geographical positions of agents as “metric 
space ” has almost no economic meaning.  
That is the key point of our treatment of theoretical economics. It is habitual that economic 
agents can be considered as primary bricks of the economic relations. Variety of economic 
agents and diversity of their economic and financial variables encourage aggregation of ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,one aually fox variableconomic all economic  ined pitmoody earisk orati metz cantor moody pitsimply above aributi ined  that it variety

"," 6 agents by some parameters to assess their collective variables. That inspires distribution of 
agents by industries or economic sectors to assess collective variables of sectors. Such 
approximation helps model mutual impact of economic variables of different industry 
sectors. Distribution of agents by industries allows Wassily Leontief develop his Input-
Output Analysis as a model of the world economy (Leontief, 1955; 1973). Distribution of 
agents by parameters as wealth, age, risk ratings and etc., allows study collective variables of 
groups of agents. Introduction of parameters those help aggregate agents within certain range 
of parameters establishes ground for definition of collective economic variables of group of 
agents. For example, collective energy consumption of agents those belong to same industry 
determines energy consumption of the particular industry. 
We believe that usage of risk ratings in a way similar to the current common practice (Fitc h, 
2017; 2018; Moody ’s, 2009; 2018; S&P, 2014; 2018) can help describe economic evolution 
in economic metric spaces. Assessment of risk ratings of large banks – economic agents, can 
be treated alike to assessment of coordinates of economic agents in metric space. To do that 
the current methodologies for assessments of risk ratings should be upgraded. Indeed, the key 
issue of risk assessment is the notation of risk grades. Current notations of risk grades serve 
the only goal – they protect the business model of the particular rating agency. Risk grade 
systems of different agencies have different letter notations and agencies use different 
number of grades. Each agency has its own risk rating methodology. Business of Fitch, 
Moody ’s and S&P to a great extent is determined and protected by their specific 
methodology, risk grade notations and reputation. However, letter notation of risk grades is 
not the only way denote the value of risk grade and for sure is not the best one. Almost 80 
years ago Durand (1941) and later Myers and Forgy (1963) proposed numerical credit grade 
systems. Actually, there are no any obstacles in transition from letter grade to numerical 
grade system. There is absolutely no difference how one note risk grades: as AAA, A, BB  or 
as 1, 3, 5 . The only impact of transition from letter to numerical grades concerns unification 
of methodologies of different risk rating agencies. Only prevention of major rating agencies 
in their ambition to protect their business hinders the transition from letter to numerical risk 
grade systems. In our opinion the effect of transition will be the opposite. Transition from 
letter grades to numerical grades system will boost the world risk rating business by much 
more than 100 times. We assume that the first enterprise that will understand th at issue can 
take over the multi-hundred billions market.  
Actually, one can consider letter credit risk grades AAA, AA, BB , etc., as points x1, x2,… on 
numerical axis. Risk grades have conditional meaning and one can always take grades as ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,that sudistributeasy leotie input output analysis leotie distributintrodufor  t moody assessment to ined current risk eabusiness pitmoody almost  myers for gy aually tre t only itransit aually risk

"," 7 points x1, x2,… of the unit interval [0,1] . One can take most secure grade AAA to be equal 
zero and most risky grade to be equal 1. Unification of different risk grade methodologies of 
major rating agencies allows project their letter risk grades as unified numerical grades of the 
unit interval [0,1]. Such transition is not the problem of economics or risk management, but 
only the problem of common agreement between major rating agencies.  
We propose introduce numeric continuous  risk grades those fill interval [0,1]  instead of 
discrete numeric grades . Usage of continuous risk grades is also the problem of the 
methodology of risk assessment only. There are absolutely no economic obstacles that 
prevent usage of numeric continuous risk grades. We avoid here discuss unified risk 
methodology. We are sure that high professional teams of researchers of rating agencies or 
team as Fox, et al.  (2017) can solve that problem and develop reasonable rating 
methodologies for assessment of risk rating of different economic agents under action of 
different risks. We propose that unified methodology can deliver assessment of ratings for all 
economic agents of the entire economy for different economic and financial risks those affect 
economic evolution. We show below, that the proposed transition from letter risk grades to 
numeric continuous risk grades gives great advantages for the development of the theoretical 
economics, description of business cycles, economic fluctuations, financial markets, 
economic forecasting and etc. Usage of continuous risk grades establishes new approach to 
the description of the economic evolution, financial markets and uncovers unnoticed tough 
hurdles and overlooked economic notions on the way to “correct ” economic theory.

investment, credit, production, political, technological decisions generate almost all risks. We 
consider risks as essential part, as integral condition of any economic and financial processes. 
We believe that economic growth is possible under the action of risks only. The 
disappearance of risk will initiate halt of all economic processes and destruction of the 
macroeconomics. Numerous risks impact agents and economic processes. Some of risks have 
more effect on economic processes than others. It seems almost impossible take into account 
and estimate risk ratings of all possible risks. The choice of one, two, three most influential 
risks and assessments of agents ’ ratings under action of these risks give definite 
approximation of the economic processes. Continuous risk ratings of the single risk fill the 
unit interval [0,1] and ratings of two or three most influential risks fill the unit cubes in the R2

"," 8 in the R2 or R3 space. Indeed, agents ’ economic activity, market, technology and numerous 
other factors impact entire economy and force change of agents ’ risk ratings. Such “motion ” 
of risk rating of large banks is already described for decades by risk transition matrices 
provided by rating agencies (Metz Cantor, 2007; Moody ’s, 2009; Fitch, 2017; S&P, 2018) . 
Usage of continuous risk grades helps clarify agents ’ risk motion. L et’s take that element of 
risk transition matrix aij describes probability of transition of particular agent from risk rating 
xi to rating xj during time term T. Then one can assess probable velocity υij of agent ’s risk 
motion from xi to xj with probability aij in economic domain during time T and mean risk 
velocity υi of agent at point xi as: 
𝒗𝑖𝑗=𝒙𝑗−𝒙𝑖
𝑇    ;    𝒗 𝑖=∑𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑗  𝒗𝑖𝑗   ;    ∑𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑗 = 1   (2.1) 
We remind, that current notations of letter risk grades don ’t allow interpret the difference 
between two grades xj - xi as a length (2.1). Hence one can’t introduce such a notion as a 
mean velocity υi (2.1) of agent with risk rate coordinate xi. Change of notations as proposed 
by Durand (1941) and Myers and Forgy (1963) opens a new look on description of evolution 
of the economic agents and the entire economy under action of n risks in the economic 
domain determined as unit cube [0,1]n. Dimension n of the unit cube defines the number of 
risks under consideration of particular economic approximation. 
And now it is time to remind about the scales  of the economic approximation. The long road 
above now led us to important point: for the given number n of major risks, economic 
approximations in the economic domain [0,1]n is determined by the choice of two scales: by 
the time interval Δ and by the space scale l:  0<l≤1. The time interval Δ determines scale  of 
time aggregation and averaging of agents ’ economic variables and parameters during Δ and 
establishes the divisions of the time axis multiply of Δ. The space scale  l determines 
aggregation and averaging of economic variables and parameters of agents with risk 
coordinates near point x in a small volume dV~ln of the economic domain. Such aggregation 
makes description of agents by their risk coordinates more roughen by the scale dV~ln. Space 
scale l and aggregation by dV~ln allows develop economic approximations starting with 
assumption of imaginable precise assessment of agents ’ risk ratings and approximate their 
evolution for l: 0<l<1 and up to description of the entire economy for l=1. Thus space scales  
0<l≤1 delivers the spectrum, sequence of economic approximations determined by 
aggregation of agents by different volumes dV~ln in the economic domain [0,1]n. In a sense, 
Leontief ’s input-output analysis is based on division of the entire economy by industries. In a

"," 9 economic domain. Both approaches distribute economic agents by different “boxes ”. 
Leontief collects agents by “boxes ” that define different industries and studies input-output 
transactions between industries. We collect agents by risk coordinates inside “boxes ” dV~ln 
near risk point x, study evolution of their collective economic variables and describe market 
transactions between agents with coordinates at risk points x and y. That “small ” difference 
opens wide opportunities for development of the economic theory in the economic domain. 
The main distinction: we replace aggregation of agents by non-metric “industry boxes ” with 
aggregation of agents inside small “boxes ” dV~ln near  risk points of metric space Rn. That 
uncovers complex and important unnoticed and overlooked economic variables, relations and 
processes those define the state and conduct the dynamics of macroeconomics. Disregarding 
of these hidden variables and processes cause lack of the adequate description of the current 
state of the economy and incapacity of trustworthy durable economic forecasting. 
We consider here main definitions of collective variables and their flows and refer (Olkhov, 
2016a-2020) for further details. As we mentioned above, economic decisions of agents, 
market trade, economic fluctuations and other factors cause the change of agents ’ risk 
coordinates. That results in motion of agents with risk velocity υi (2.1) in economic domain 
[0,1]n. Motion of particular agent with velocity υi causes that agent carries his economic 
variables in the economic domain. Aggregation of agents and their variables near risk point x 
of economic domain inside sma ll “box” dV~ln during time Δ determines collective variables 
inside that “box” - volume dV~ln. Let Ai(tj,xi) denote additive variable A of agent i with 
coordinates xi at moment tj. As additive variable one can consider agent ’s asset, credit, 
investment, demand, profits and etc. Sum of additive variables of group of agents equals 
collective variable of the group. Let take that time series tj obey (2.2)

"," 10 economic variables that are overlooked by current economic models. Indeed, as we outlined 
above, each agent i at point (tj,xi) with variable Ai(tj,xi) carries that variable with risk velocity 
υi (2.1). Collective result of such risk motion for all agents inside “box” dV averaged during 
Δ (2.2) defines the collective flow PA(t,x) that carries collective variable A(t,x) with collective 
velocity υA(t,x) (2.4) in the economic domain [0,1]n  
𝑷𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)=1

𝑗=1 𝒗𝑖(𝑡𝑗, 𝒙𝒊) = 𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)𝒗𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)  (2.4) 
It is important to underline that notions of collective flow and collective velocity have sense 
even if one considers aggregation of all agents of the entire economy and “box” dV coincides 
with entire economic domain [0,1]n, so that dV = [0,1]n. In that case macroeconomic variable 
A(t) takes form 
𝐴(𝑡)=1

𝑷𝐴(𝑡)=1
𝑁∑ ∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝑡𝑗, 𝒙𝒊) 𝑖𝑁
𝑗=1 𝒗𝑖(𝑡𝑗, 𝒙𝒊) = 𝐴 (𝑡)𝒗𝐴(𝑡)  (2.6) 
We call the transition from description of economic variables assigned with particular 
economic agent Ai(tj,xi) to description of economic variables A(t,x) (2.3) as functions of 
coordinates x in economic domain as  economic continuous media approximation . Flows 
PA(t,x) and velocities υA(t,x) (2.4) of each particular additive economic variable A describe its 
motion in the economic domain. We consider continuous media approximations for different 
time and space scales (Δ,l) as set of intermediate approximations between description of 
economics as separate agents and macroeconomic approximation derived by collecting 
variables of all agents of the economy. As we show (Olkhov, 2017c; 2017d; 2018; 2019a-
2020), to derive correct description of macroeconomic approximation one should take into 
account collective flows and velocities (2.6). However, these macroeconomic flows and 
velocities (2.6) related with numerous different macroeconomic variables A(t) (2.5) are 
unnoted and overlooked by modern economic theories and that gap definitely causes failures 
of macroeconomic forecasting. 
Relations (2.5) introduce one more important and still unnoticed economic factor – 
macroeconomic mean risk XA(t) (2.7) related with particular collective economic variable A:

"," 11 velocity υA(t) (2.6) as well as fluctuations of collective velocity υA(t,x) (2.4) inside economic 
domain reflect processes that are currently noted as business cycles (Olkhov, 2017c; 2017d; 
2019a; 2019c; 2020 ). Different economic variables A,B,C  define different collective 
velocities υA(t,x), υB(t,x), υC(t,x) and different mean risks XA(t), XB(t), XC(t). Their mutual 
interactions and their oscillations inside the unit cube [0,1]n of the economic domain 
establish complex picture of collective fluctuations of macroeconomic variables those 
observed and treated as business cycles. We consider these overlooked hidden collective 
oscillations of economic variables, their mean risks and velocities as the origin of observed 
economic business cycles. 
Economic continuous media approximation in the economic domain [0,1]n uncovers 
important and unnoticed wave generation and propagation of small disturbances of collective 
economic variables and market transactions. In economics the term “wave ” is in use at least 
since Kondratieff ’s waves (Kondratieff, 1935). However, Kondratieff ’s waves as well as 
economic cycles describe oscillations of economic variables in time only. To observe and 
describe economic waves one should consider economic processes in certain space. 
Introduction of the economic domain as a unit cube [0,1]n in Rn uncovers possible wave 
propagation of small disturbances of collective economic variables and market transactions as 
functions of risk coordinates in the economic domain. We described (Olkhov, 2016a-2017b; 
2019c) possible propagation of small waves through the economic domain and a different 
type of “surface-like ” waves those propagate along the borders of the economic domain. We 
show that possible exponential amplification of the wave amplitudes during the propagation 
can cause rise of perturbations ’ amplitudes and result in development of crises processes. 
Currently, the influence of the economic wave propagation on macroeconomic evolution is 
completely unnoted. 
However, the hidden complexity of the collective economic variables and their flows in 
economic domain delivers only small fraction of the difficulties on the way for development 
of the comprehensive economic theory. In the next section we consider unnoticed variables 
and overlooked economic properties related with the main drivers of the economic 
development – market trade and expectations.

"," 12 prices of assets and commodities that are adopted by the economy. Each agent involved into 
particular market transaction takes own decision on the amount of the trade value and volume 
under personal expectations. Relations between expectations of agents and performance of 
market transactions establish a complex puzzle for the theoretical economics. Expectations 
determine preferences and decisions of agents those result in market trade performance. 
Impacts of expectations on world markets and economic evolution are under research for 
decades (Muth, 1961; Lucas, 1972; Hansen and Sargent 1979; Blume and Easley 1984; 
Brock and Hommes, 1998; Manski 2004; Brunnermeier and Parker 2005 ; Manski, 2017; 
Farmer, 2019). Expectations generate market trade stochasticity and their measuring and 
modelling remain the major puzzle of financial economics. Ties between expectations and 
economic policy (Sargent and Wallace, 1976) result complex impact on world markets and 
economic development. Methods and description of collective economic variables as 
functions of risk coordinates in economic domain delivers the unified approach to description 
of the world markets, economic expectations and economic policy. A first approximation of 
the relations between market trades and economic expectations described as functions of risk 
coordinates in the economic domain was developed by Olkhov (2019b; 2019c; 2020). For 
simplicity in this paper we consider only preliminary, general notions and definitions 
required for description of the market trade and expectations in the economic domain.  
The idea for description of market trade in economic domain is simple and in some sense is 
alike to Leontief ’s model (Leontief, 1955; 1973). Leontief collects agents by industries, but 
we collect agents inside small volume dV~ln near points of economic domain [0,1]n. Leontief 
considers input-output trade relations between industries. We describe collective market trade 
between agents those belong to small volumes dV~ln near points x and y of the economic 
domain [0,1]n. That “small ” difference from Leontief ’s model opens wide opportunities for 
description collective market trade in the economic domain [0,1]n of metric space Rn. 
Actually, we reproduce economic continuous media approximation introduced for description 
of collective economic variables in Sec.2 to model collective market trade and their flows in 
the economic domain of double dimension. Motion of agents in the economic domain 
generates flows of collective market trades. Assumptions on relations between market trade 
and agents expectations allow introduce notions of collective expectations and their collective 
flows in the economic domain. Notions of collective market trade and expectations as well as 
notions of their collective flows in the economic domain are unnoticed and overlooked by 
current economic theories. ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,earelatns eeatns impas math lucas hanseargent   brock homa runner meter parker ma farmer eeatns tiargent wallace methods  for t leotie leotie leotie leotie  that leotie raually sec motassumptns notns

"," 13 Let us explain briefly above argumentation in more details. Let us consider seller and buyer 
at points xi and yj of the economic domain [0,1]n. These two agents at time tm perform market 
transaction with a particular asset or commodity at volume U(tm,xi,yj) and value C(tm,xi,yj). 
Let denote C(t,x,y) and U(t,x,y) as collective trade value and volume between sellers and

corresponding motion of market transactions (3.1; 3.4) in the economic domain of double 
dimension 2n. For example, collective flow PU(t,z) of trade volume depends on collective 
flows PxU(t,z) of sellers at point x and collective flows PyU(t,z) of buyers at point y:

"," 14 expectations can be treated as a  “glue” that ties up impact of the variables, transactions and 
economic policy and produces market trade decisions of agents.  
Even simplified model of mutual dependence of expectations and market trades uncovers 
unnoticed properties of collective expectations determined by collective trade value and 
volume (Olkhov, 2019b; 2019c; 2021d). Indeed, according to economic continuous media 
approximation one should define notions of collective expectations as functions of risk 
coordinate in economic domain. To do that one should collect expectations of agents in a 
small volume dV and average them during the interval Δ (2.2). Sum of different agents ’ 
expectations is a tough problem that requires methodological introduction of unified measure 
of different expectations. That is one of the overlooked problems of current economic studies 
of agents ’ expectations and the problem is far from solution. However, if one assumes that 
the unified measure of expectations is selected and expectations of different agents can be 
observed and assessed by the unified measure, definition of collective agents ’ expectations 
still remains a tough problem. Indeed, different agents ’ expectations are “responsible ” for 
trade decisions of different value. It seems not fair sum on equal basis expectation 1 that is 
responsible for trade worth $1 and expectation 2 responsible for trade worth $10MM. We 
propose that to collect expectations of different agents one should multiply the measure of the 
expectation responsible for the value of particular trade by the value of that trade. Thereafter, 
one should multiply by the trade volume the measure of expectation that is responsible for the 
particular trade volume. These simple rules result definitions of collective expectations as 
weighted by the market trade value and volume they approved. For example, if U(t m,xi,yj;k,l) 
at time tm denotes trade volume between seller at xi and buyer at yj (3.1) under sellers 
expectations exsU(tm,xi;k) of type k and buyers expectation exbU(tm,yj;l) of type l then 
collective sellers expectations ExsU(t,z) of the trade volume take form:

and by buyer. Expectations of seller and buyer can be different and thus definition of 
collective expectations should identify collective expectations of sellers and buyers. Thus

"," 15 those impact the trade value and volume of sellers and two similar expectations of buyers. As 
we mentioned above, motion of agents in economic domain [0,1]n cause motion of trades in 
economic domain of double dimension and that result motion of collective expectations. 
Flows of collective expectation in bounded economic domain result slow fluctuations that are 
alike to business cycles of expectations. Econometric observations of such cycles of 
expectations are absent. However, overlooked impact of expectation ’s cycles on cycles of 
market trade and conventional business cycles of economic growth, investment and etc. hide 
important tools and relations of their management.  
We believe that the nature of economic processes, flows of economic variables, market 
transactions and expectations in the bounded economic domain make absolutely impossible 
maintaining permanent economic growth without crises and recessions. Nevertheless, 
econometric observations and theoretical predictions of mutual dependence between 
collective expectations, market trade and variables could deliver financial authorities, Central 
Banks and politicians more tools, reasons and argumentations fo r achieving economic 
prosperity with less losses. 
At the end of this subsection we outline that expectations of agents to a great extend are 
determined by existing economic, financial, market and etc., laws and regulations. Regularly  
adjusted political decisions those disturb current economic laws are usually noted as 
economic and financial policy. Economic laws that conduct market trade, taxes, production 
and mining, environment protection and etc., – all that amount of economic laws and 
regulations are permanently adjusted by economic policy. That result unpredictable 
disturbances of agents expectations those projected into market fluctuations and 
macroeconomic uncertainty. Modelling of that jurisdictive “black box ” as fourth dimension 
of the economic theory and description of its impact on economic evolution, risk variations,

Randomness of the market trade is studied for decades. In that section we demonstrate that

"," 16 economic theory and forecasting. Agents variables collected by entire economy or by  
different “boxes ” as industries, wealth, age range, risk coordinates and etc., determine the 
economic state, the starting conditions for the economic development and growth. However, 
agents variables itself even collected in any manner over the economy unable generate 
economic evolution. Only market trade establish es and causes the economic and financial 
development. Only market trade moves the current state of the economy to the future 
prosperity. One should remember that all theories and forecasts those utilize relations 
between economic variables only are eluding and fudging description of the real economic 
ties and laws those conduct economic dynamics. Usual common statements like “supply 
depends on demand ” or “investment depend on bank rate ” describe relations between 
variables, but omit several intermediate and complex chains of market transactions and 
neglect economic relations those conduct market trade. That is understandable desire to 
derive predictions under simplified assumptions.  
Below we show that such shortening economic relations result in disregarding numerous 
significant economic properties and variables those conduct market trade and economic 
forecasts. To start with let us consider as example the market trade of particular asset or 
commodity. Let denote as C(t i) and U(t i) the value and volume of the market trade at time ti at 
a price p(ti), so trivial relations between the trade value, volume and price take form:  
𝐶(𝑡 𝑖) = 𝑝(𝑡 𝑖)𝑈(𝑡 𝑖)     (4.1) 
Simple trade relations define price p(ti) of particular trade at ti. Modern market trade is a 
high-frequency process with high variations of the trade value, volume and price. Most 
economic and financial models consider averaging and smoothing procedures of market trade 
time-series during selected time averaging interval Δ. Financial market models can take the 
averaging interval Δ to be equal minutes, hours or days and macroeconomic models deal with 
the averaging interval Δ to be equal weeks, months and years. Time averaging during the 
interval Δ establishes time axis division multiply of Δ of the theoretical description of 
economics and financial markets . Different choice of the averaging interval Δ determines 
different approximations of the market dynamics and economic evolution.  
Let us select the averaging interval Δ and study statistical properties of the market trade 
value, volume and price treated as random variables during Δ. Below we explain why and 
how statistical properties of the trade value and volume determine statistical properties of the 
market price and how all tha t define statistical properties of the economic variables. 
For simplicity let us take initial market trade time-series at time ti as multiple of ε and assume 
that there are N members of time-series in each interval Δ: ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z, only only one usual that below to  simple mormost nancial time dferent  below for

Time-series of the market trade value C(t i), volume U(t i) and price p(ti) during each averaging 
interval Δk are very irregular. Aggregation or averaging of irregular variables during interval 
Δk helps derive smooth variables and develop reliable predictions. For simplicity we consider 
initial time-series of the market trade value C(t i), volume U(t i) and price p(ti) as random 
variables during each averaging interval Δk. Asset pricing theory is the key problem of 
financial economics and the literature is endless. We refer only few studies (Bachelier, 1900; 
Kendall and Hill, 1953; Muth, 1961; Sharpe, 1964; Fama, 1965; Karpoff, 1987; Cochrane 
and Hansen, 1992; Cochrane, 2001; Hansen, 2013). Any reader can add to that list hundreds 
of his preferred references. Above references confirm only one issue – any new treatment of 
the asset pricing is very important for economic and financial modelling. 
We present derivation of the statistical properties of the market random price time-series 
during averaging interval Δ due to Olkhov (2021a-2022d) and refer there for details. Our 
consideration of the market price probability follows simple thesis: relations (4.1) state that it 
is impossible independently define probabilities of the trade value C(t i), volume  U(t i) and 
price p(ti) during Δ. Given  random properties of the market trade value C(t i) and volume  U(t i) 
determine random properties of the price time-series p(ti) during Δ. In some extend definition 
of the mean price p(tk;1) during the interval Δk (4.3) as function of the mean trade value 
C(t k;1) and volume  U(t k;1) was given more then 30 years ago as volume weighted average 
price (VWAP) (Berkowitz et.al, 1988; Buryak and Guo, 2014; Busseti and Boyd, 2015; CME 
Group, 2020 ). Definition of VWAP p(tk;1) (4.4) averaged during interval Δk is based on total 
value CΣ(tk;1) and volume UΣ(tk;1) aggregated during Δk (4.3) and follows (4.1): 
 𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 1)= 𝐸[𝑝 (𝑡𝑖)] =1

Relations (4.5) define total trade value CΣ(tk;1) and volume UΣ(tk;1) during Δk (4.3). Let us 
note mathematical expectation during Δk as E[…].  As we assume there are N trades during Δk.

"," 18 Thus VWA P p(tk;1) (4.1; 4.4) averaged during interval Δk (4.3) equals:

𝑁∑ 𝑈(𝑡 𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1∙ 1
𝑁∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 =𝐶(𝑡𝑘;1)
𝑈(𝑡𝑘;1) (4.8) 
These trivial relations  (4.4-4.8 ) uncover important consequence that is usually overlooked. 
Indeed, relations (4.1; 4.4-4.8) cause zero correlations corr{p(t i)U(t i)}=0 between time-series 
of the market trade volume U(t i) and price p(ti) during averaging interval Δk:  
𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖)]= 𝐸 [𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)]=1
𝑁∑ 𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑈(𝑡𝑖)≡1

𝑖=1 𝑈(𝑡𝑖) 1
𝑁∑ 𝑈(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 = 𝐸 [𝑝(𝑡𝑖)]𝐸[𝑈(𝑡𝑖)]     (4.9) 
Hence, from (4.9) obtain (4.10) that  corr{p(t i)U(t i)} equals zero:  
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 {𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)}=  𝐸 [𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)]− 𝐸[𝑝(𝑡𝑖)]𝐸[𝑈(𝑡𝑖)]= 0 (4.10) 
We underline that unnoticed zero correlations between price and trade volume (4.10 ) is result 
of the definition of the VWAP p(tk;1) (4.4 - 4.8). That is an important issue, as studies of the 
price-volume correlations have long history (Tauchen and Pitts, 1983; Gallant et.al., 1992; 
Campbell et.al., 1993; Odean, 1998). The choice of the VWAP p(tk;1) (4.4-4.8 ) states zero 
correlations between price and trade volume. Hence studies of the market trade price-volume 
time-series should be reconsidered with respect to definite price-volume averaging 
procedures. Economic meaning of price-volume correlations should be considered with 
respect to economic meaning of the trade volume and price probabilities. 
We underline that definition of the VWAP p(tk;1) (4.4-4.8) is not sufficient to define all 
random properties of the price p(ti) during Δk (4.3). To do that one should define all price n-th 
statistical moments p(tk;n)=E[pn(ti)]. We introduce all price n-th statistical moments as 
extension of (4.1; 4.4-4.8). For all n=1,2,3,… we take usual n-th statistical moments of the 
trade value C(t k;n) and total sums of n-th power of trade value CΣ(tk;n) (4.11)  and n-th 
statistical moments of the trade volume U(t k;n) and total sums of n-th power of volume 
UΣ(tk;n) (4.12) during Δk (4.3) as: 
𝐶(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]=  1
𝑁 𝐶Σ(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)     ;    𝐶 Σ(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)=∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1   (4.11) 
𝑈(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]=  1
𝑁 𝑈Σ(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)     ;    𝑈 Σ(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)=∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1   (4.12) 
Taking n-th power of (4.1) we obtain: 
𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖) = 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)    (4.13) 
We extend definition of VWAP (4.4-4.8) and for all n=1,2,3,…  introduce price n-th statistical 
moments p(tk;n)=E[pn(ti)] (4.14) as: 
𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)= 𝐸 [𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]=1

It is obvious, that (4.14) results:

"," 19 To explain and justify our definition (4.14; 4.15) of the market price n-th statistical moments 
p(tk;n)=E[pn(ti)] we mention that we extend VWAP logic for (4.13) as n-th power of (4.1). 
Average n-th power of price E[pn(ti)] is determined as n-th power volume Un(ti) weighted 
average of n-th power of price pn(ti) (4.14). Both relations (4.14; 4.15) retain the meaning of 
market n-th power of price pn(ti) as coefficient between n-th power of trade value Cn(ti) and 
trade volume Un(ti) (4.13) . Definitions (4.14; 4.15) maintain meaning of price n-th statistical 
moment p(t;n)=  E[pn(ti)] as ratio of total sum of n-th power of value Cn(ti) to sum of n-th 
power volume Un(ti) during averaging interval Δk (4.3). 
One can easy obtain that (4.11- 4.15) cause zero correlations between time-series of n-th 
power of price pn(ti) and trade volume Un(ti): 
𝐸[𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]=1
𝑁∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)=∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)
∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑁
𝑖=1
𝑁= 𝐸 [𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]𝐸[𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]  
Hence correlations corr{pn(ti)Un(ti)} between time series of n-th power of price pn(ti) and 
trade volume Un(ti) equal zero:  
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 {𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)}=  𝐸 [𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]− 𝐸[𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]𝐸[𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖)]= 0 (4.16) 
Zero correlations (4.16 ) for all n=1,2,3,…  don’t imply statistical independence between price 
and volume time-series. For example, from (4 .14; 4.15 ) one can easy obtain correlations 
corr(pU2) between price p(ti) and squares of trade volume Un(ti) (Olkhov, 2022c). For brevity 
we omit ti and obtain:  
𝐸[𝑝𝑈2]= 𝐸 [𝑝]𝐸[𝑈2]+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 {𝑝𝑈2}     ;    𝐸 [𝑝𝑈2]= 𝐸 [𝐶𝑈]= 𝐸 [𝐶]𝐸[𝑈]+ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{ 𝐶𝑈}   
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{𝑝𝑈2} = 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟{ 𝐶𝑈} − 𝑝 (𝑡𝑘; 1)𝜎2(𝑈)   (4.17) 
Here we denote market trade volume volatility during Δk (4.3) as σ2(U): 
𝜎2(𝑈)= 𝑈 (𝑡𝑘; 2)− 𝑈2(𝑡𝑘; 1)   (4.18) 
Correlation corr{pU2} of price and squares of trade volume depends on correlation corr{ CU} 
of the trade value C and trade volume U, on VWAP p(tk;1) and on trade volume volatility 
σ2(U). We repeat, that unnoticed zero correlations between price and trade volume as a 
consequence of VWAP introduced 30 years ago underlines importance of market-based 
approach to description of price random properties. Price should be studied as result of 
market trade (4.1) and that causes (4.4-4.10). Our definition (4.14-4.15) of price statistical 
moments p(tk;n)=E[pn(ti)] for all n=1,2,3,…  causes zero correlations between n-th power of 
price pn(ti) and trade volume Un(ti). Relations (4.14; 4.15) define all price statistical moments 
p(tk;n) and hence completely determine price as random variable during Δk (4.3) as functions 
of statistical moments of the market trade value C(t k;n) (4.11) and volume U(t k;n) (4.12).  ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,to ge uboth  unitns  uone unce uuzero for u for re correlat price our urelatns

"," 20 However, any econometric records of market trade during Δk (4.3) allow assess only finite 
number of market statistical moments C(t k;n) and U(t k;n). Thus, researchers should consider 
approximations of the market trade value and volume probabilities, determined by finite 
number of statistical moments. That causes assessment of finite number of the market price 
statistical moments those determine approximations of the price probability measure. 
Predictions of the price probability should follow forecasts of the market trade statistical 
moments. These ties between stochasticity of the market trade and randomness of the market 
price underline their economic nature and mutual dependence.   
Predictions of the market trade n-th statistical moments for n=2,3,..  uncover additional 
unnoticed variables and overlooked economic problems. Indeed, current economic theories 
consider variables composed by sums of the 1-st degree variables of economic agents. 
Macroeconomic investment, credits, assets are determined as sums of corresponding 
variables of agents of the entire economy. In turn, if one ignores impact of consumption and 
production, then agent ’s additive economic variables during interval Δk (4.3) are composed 
by sums of 1-st degree market trade values CΣ(tk;1) (4.11) and volumes UΣ(tk;1) (4.12). 
Actually, sums of n-th power of market trade values CΣ(tk;n) (4.11) and volumes UΣ(tk;n) 
(4.12) during Δk (4.3) determine change of the macroeconomic variables of the n-th degree. 
These n-th degree macroeconomic variables establish direct ties between market stochasticity 
determined by market statistical moments C(t k;n) (4.11) and U(t k;n) (4.12) and unnoticed 
macroeconomic randomness. One should study evolution of n-th degree investment, credits, 
assets, because they record market stochasticity and project it into macroeconomic 
randomness. Evolution of the n-th degree macroeconomic variables depend on and impact on 
sums of n-th power of market trade values CΣ(tk;n) (4.11) and volumes UΣ(tk;n) (4.12). Their 
mutual interactions on one hand affect macroeconomic evolution and on other hand 
determine stochastic properties of the market trade statistical moments C(t k;n) and U(t k;n) 
(4.11; 4.12) and through them the market price statistical moments p(tk;n) (4.14; 4.15). 
Stochasticity of the market trade and price is intertwined into evolution of n-th degree 
economic variables. That is a really though puzzle for theoretical description.  
Meanwhile, that “can of worms ” formed by interrelations between macroeconomic variables, 
market trade and market price is only prelude, only preliminary introduction to the 
complexity of the comprehensiv e theory of economic reality. To imagine it to some extent 
one should remember that market trades to a large degree are conducted by collecti ve agents 
expectations. Expectations, in their turn, are largely shaped and established under economic 
policy decisions and economic legislative environment, regulations and laws. In their turn, ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z, that predins tse predins ined maoeconomic iaually tse one evoluttir stochastic it that meanw to eeatns in

"," 21 economic policy decisions are established by academic economists and politicians on base of 
their observations of macroeconomic variables their treatment of economic theory and their 
desires and goals to “improve ” economic performance. Each novel policy decision disturbs 
and changes existing economic legislation and laws and cause perturbations of agents ’ 
expectations. In their turn disturbed expectations perturb market trade, market price and 
cause macroeconomic shocks. Actually, politicians supported by elite economists play one of 
the leading roles in regular perturbations of agents ’ expectations, market trade, price and, 
eventually, of macroeconomic performance. 
5. Conclusion 
It is clear that one paper cannot address and discuss all unnoticed issues and overlooked 
factors that may cause failures of the modern economic theories and policies. Many tough 
problems of economic modelling those arise within the proposed unified approach to 
description of economic variables, market transactions and expectations as functions of risk 
coordinates in the economic domain are left unnoticed. However, we assume that the above 
considerations of collective economic variables, collective transactions and expectations, 
mean risks of economic variables and transactions, collective velocities and flows of 
economic variables, transactions and expectations and other specific features of modelling 
their evolution and mutual interactions in the economic domain uncovers a great amount of 
unnoticed economic variables and overlooked economic processes those configure economic 
performance. The bounds of the n-dimensional economic domain result inherent cyclical 
motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those are responsible for 
observed business cycles. Slow motion of collective economic variables and market 
transactions in the economic domain is complemented by propagation of numerous waves 
generated by small perturbations of different economic variables and market transactions. 
Ensemble of economic waves transfer perturbations over the economic domain and possible 
amplification of wave amplitudes can cause growth of economic and financial instabilities . 
Collective expectations those generally determine market trade and economic, financial, tax, 
trade and etc., laws and regulations those repeatedly disturbed by the next economic policy 
decisions complement that general view on vast variety of the theoretical economics puzzle.  
The simplest way to solve the economic problems we mentioned above is to declare that all 
these complexities don ’t exist. Probably, that is the best choice for majority.  
However, few readers may wonder in details of the results obtained and in the constructive 
proposal for the further development of the above problems and theoretical economics. ",2022-08-14T09:43:22Z,eaiaually conusit many t slow ensemble colleive t probably ver

possible gains of econometric observations and theoretical description of the unnoted and

"," 2 1. Introduction 
Cycles of economic activity, macro fluctuations of supply and demand, cycles of investment 
and economic growth, rise and decline of other macroeconomic variables are the most 
general and most influential macroeconomic processes. Macroeconomic and business cycles 
are accompanied by phases of economic growth and development but changed with 
depressions, economic and financial crises. Understanding the laws that govern macro and 
business cycles may help better measure, manage and support the prosperity periods and 
reduce losses of the economic crises. Studies of the economic and financial cycles, 
endogenous and exogenous factors that initiate, increase or decrease amplitudes and 
frequency of business cycles have a long history and remain among the most important in the 
economic research.  
Mitchel in 1927 mentioned the processes of business cycles as: “In a business cycle, the order 
of events is crisis, depression, revival, prosperity, and another crisis (or recession) ” (Mitchell, 
1927, p.79). Since then not too much was added to the treatment of the business cycles. “The 
incorporation of cyclical phenomena into the system of economic equilibrium with which 
they are in apparent contradiction, remains the crucial problem of Trade Cycle Theory ” 
(Hayek, 1933, quoted by Lucas, 1995). “Why aggregate variables undergo repeated 
fluctuations about trend, all of essentially the same character? Prior to Keynes ’ General 
Theory, the resolution of this question was regarded as one of the main outstanding 
challenges to economic research, and attempts to meet this challenge were called business 
cycle theory ” (Lucas, 1995). Questions on properties and modelling of business cycles 
remain relevant now and will attract researchers for years. “Theories of business cycles 
should presumably help us to understand the salient characteristics of the observed pervasive 
and persistent non seasonal fluctuations of the economy ” (Zarnowitz, 1992). “One of the 
most controversial questions in macroeconomics is what explains business-cycle 
fluctuations? ” (Huggett, 2017). Studies of business cycle since Mitchell (1927), Tinbergen 
(1935) and Schumpeter (1939) were followed by hundreds publications (Lucas, 1980 ; 
Kydland and Prescott 1982; 1991; Zarnowitz 1992; Lucas 1995; Diebold and Rudebusch 
1999; Bangia, Diebold and Schuermann, 2000; Rebelo 2005; Kiyotaki 2011; Diebold and 
Yilmaz 2013; Jorda, Schularick and Taylor 2016; Huggett 2017). 
It is obvious that one of the most important problems concern the origin, the source, the 
initial reasons for the business cycle fluctuations and transitions from the development phase 
to the “crisis, depression ” phase. These problems were studied by (Shapiro and Watson, 
1988; Shea, 1999; Andrle, Brůha and Solmaz, 2017).

"," 3 associated with risk growth. Impacts of risk are treated as part of business cycle studies and 
count numerous publications (Alvarez and Jermann, 1999; Bangia, Diebold and Schuermann, 
2000; Tallarini, 2000; Pesaran, Schuermann and Treutler, 2007; Mendoza, Yue, 2012; 
Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2013). Selected papers on financial risks over 100 years of 
research (Diebold, 2012) outlines a special chapter on “Financial Risk And The Business 
Cycle ”. Risk measurements, concepts, techniques and tools (McNeil, Frey and Embrechts, 
2005) and relations to macro modeling (Brunnermeier and Krishnamurthy, 2014) present 
only top slice of risks and business cycle studies. Economic crises increase risks of most 
economic agents and agents change their economic activity in a way that decrease the ir risks. 
Relations between risks of economic agents and transitions from one cycle phase to another 
impact dynamics of the business cycles. Studies of such effect and relations of risk 
assessment and the business cycle development are described by (Tallarini, 2000; Pesaran, 
Schuermann & Treutler, 2007; Mendoza & Yue, 2012; Diebold, 2012). Economic and 
financial risks affect economic stability (Huang, Zhou & Zhu, 2009; Nicolò & Lucchetta, 
2011) and pricing models (Bollerslev & Zhang, 2003). Numerous publications study the 
mutual relations between risks and business cycles (Alvarez & Jermann, 1999; Tallarini, 
2000; Pesaran, Schuermann & Treutler, 2007; Christiano, Motto & Rostagno, 2013). General 
equilibrium considers business cycles as transitions from one equilibrium state to another: 
“The real business cycle theory is a business cycle application of the Arrow-Debreu model, 
which is the standard general equilibrium theory of market economies. ” (Kiyotaki 2011). 
“Business deterministic cycles will be shown to appear in a purely endogenous fashion under 
laisser faire. Markets will be assumed to clear in the Walrasian sense at every date, and 
traders will have perfect foresight along the cycles ”. (Grandmont, 1985). “Real business 
cycle models view aggregate economic variables as the outcomes of the decisions made by 
many individual agents acting to maximize their utility subject to production possibilities and 
resource constraints. More explicitly, real business cycle models ask the question: How do 
rational maximizing individuals respond over time to changes in the economic environment 
and what implications do those responses have for the equilibrium outcomes of aggregate 
variables? ” (Plosser, 1989). Most business cycle models follow general economic 
equilibrium framework (Lucas, 1975; Kydland & Prescott, 1982; 1991; Grandmont, 1985; 
Mullineux & Dickinson, 1992; Farmer & Woodford, 1997; Kiyotaki, 2011; Bilbiie, Ghironi 
& Melitz, 2012; Mendoza & Yue, 2012; Growiec, McAdam & Mućk, 2015; Engle, 2017).

"," 4 cycle properties arise questions that description of the business cycles may need new 
approaches beyond the general equilibrium concept.  
We outline three interrelated economic issues: business cycles, accounting and risk 
assessment. Business cycles describe fluctuations of macroeconomic and financial variables 
as economic growth, supply and demand, investment and profits and etc. All macro variables 
and macroeconomic data are determined by and are depend on accounting data of separate 
economic agents – banks, corporations, companies and etc. Principles and accuracy of 
corporate accounting define the accuracy of macroeconomic and financial variables and 
impact the accuracy on national accounts. On the other hand corporate accounting is heavily 
relies on risk assessment. Correct corporate accounting must take into consideration impact 
of intra-corporate risks and action of macroeconomic, market, financial and other economic 
and financial risks those establish corporate risk environment. Macroeconomic risks change 
during transitions from one phase of business cycle to another. Thus evolution of business 
cycles affects risks of economic agents and hence causes variations of corporate and bank  
accounting. Indeed, assessments of corporate assets depend on agents risk assessments . 
Hence rise or decline of risks induces opposite asset valuation – decline of asset value with 
risk growth and rise of value with mitigating risks. The evolution of the business cycles 
depends on strong feedback of accounting data, asset valuation, agents risks and many other 
factors.  
In (Olkhov, 2016-2019c) we developed successive approximations that describe evolution of 
macroeconomic variables, transactions and expectations. We consider pure theoretical 
models. As the central property of the economic evolution we consider the collective risk 
ratings. We show that macroeconomic variables as supply and demand, investment and 
credits, profits and consumption and etc., are associated with corresponding collective mea n 
risks. Macroeconomic evolution is accompanied by motion of numerous mean risks related to 
different macro variables. We show that cyclical macroeconomic development that is usually 
considered as business cycles is escorted with fluctuations of corresponding mean risks. The 
initial reasons, political or economic factors, other shocks that that can govern business cycle 
may be different. But any business cycle is characterized by fluctuations of mean risks. As 
illustration of this statement we present example that describes cycles of supply and demand 
that are accompanied with fluctuations of mean supply and mean demand risks.

universal tool for business cycle management. Complexity of relations between business ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z, business all principlocorre maoeconomic  ined nce t i  as  maoeconomic  t but as econometrics lexity

processes. 
In Sec. 2 we explain the meaning of the economic domain and introduce main assumptions 
that use agents risk ratings as their coordinates. In Sec 3 we discuss main notions that 
describe the continuous economic media approximation in the economic domain. In Sec 4 we 
explain how simple assumptions on economic interactions may model motion of mean risks 
in economic domain and why this motion cause business cycle fluctuations. We collect 
almost all formulas into Appendices A, B, C. In Appendices we give formal definitions of 
economic notions in the economic domain and derive the equations that govern the business 
cycles. We use roman letters A, b, c  to define scalars and bold X, y, v  to define vectors. 
Reference (3.5) means equation 5 in the Section 3.  
2. Main assumptions 
We regard economics as a set of economic agents those perform various market trades. 
Agent-based economic modeling studied by many researchers and we refer Poggio et.al. 
(1999), Tesfatsion and Judd (2006 ), LeBaron and Tesfatsion (2008) and Silverman (2018) to 
outline that agent-based models (ABM) are well known and are under active research for last 
decades. We regard all economic entities like multinational corporations, hedge funds, largest 
banks, small companies and even households as economic agents. Agents have many 
economic and financial properties those establish the macroeconomic and financial variables: 
investment and credits, asset and debts, profits and taxes, production function and etc. Some 
economic variables are additive. For example, sum of credits, assets, profits (without 
duplication) of group of agents equals total credits, assets, profits of the group of agents. Sum 
of agents additive economic and financial variables determine macroeconomic variables. 
Sum of agents investment, taxes, assets (withou t duplication ) of all agents in economy equals 
macro investment, taxes, assets and etc. Agents also have non-additive variables. For 
example price, tax rates, bank rates are non-additive variables. Non-additive variables are 
determined as ratio of additive: price is the ratio of value to volume of market trades, bank 
rate is the ratio of cost of credit per time term to loan body and etc. Additive variables 
determine all non-additive variables. Hence description of economic processes and the 
business cycle in particular can use additive economic variables only. Almost all additive 
variables change due to market transactions executed by agents. Agents sell and buy 
commodities, assets, provide credits and investment and etc. These transactions change the 
amount of agents assets, commodities, investment and etc. Agent s perform market 
transactions under action of their expectations. Agents create their expectations on base of ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,isec isec isec  appendiciappendic reference searticial intellence  agent ptfats judo le barotfats sverma  some for sum sum  for noadditive nce almost  tse agent

dynamics, inflation and bank rates and etc. Agents expectations may reflect expectations of 
other agents, their spirits or weather forecasts and any other factors that can impact agents 
decisions go into particular market transaction. Agents expectations are the main tool that 
deliver influence and perturbations of social, mental, political, economical and any other 
factors on market transactions and macroeconomic evolution.  
We regard methods and models that describe relations between economic variables, market 
transactions and expectations as the essence of theoretical economics.  
2.1. Risk assessment  
For decades, international risk rating agencies like Fitch, Moody ’s, S&P (Metz and Cantor, 
2007; Chane-Kon, et.al, 2010; Kraemer and Vazza, 2012) assess credit risk ratings for largest 
banks and multinational corporations. Regular assessments of risk rating of major banks and 
corporations are reasons for taking investment decisions by largest financial institutions, 
pension funds and etc. Risk ratings take values of risk grades and are denoted by letters as 
AAA, AA, BB  and etc. (Metz and Cantor, 2007; Chane-Kon, et.al, 2010, Kraemer and Vazza, 
2012). Due to their economic activity and due to evolution of economic environment agents 
change their risk ratings during some time. Rating agencies evaluate and publish risk 
transition matrices that describe the probability that agent ’s risk may change from one risk 
grade to another during certa in time term T (Belkin, 1998; Bangia, Diebold and Schuermann, 
2000; Ho et.al, 2017; S&P, 2018). Each rating company uses its own letter notations of risk 
grades. Particular choice of risk grades is determined by risk methodology and rating 
companies use their own grades to protect and enlarge their own business. However at least 
80 years ago Durand (1941) and then Myers and Forgy (1963) proposed numerical risk 
grades. Last years numerical risk grades are used as a tool to compare the risk assessments 
made by different rating agencies, as a method for development of the credit scoring and etc. 
(Becker and Milbourn, 2010; Morkoetter, Stebler and Westerfeld, 2016; King, Ongena and 
Tarashev, 2017; WB Group, 2019). We outline numerical risk grades because they bring the 
new insight s into methods and models of theoretical economics. The choice between letters 
or numerical risk grades is determined by methodology and preferences of rating agencies. 
Any set of letter risk grades can be denoted as set of discrete points in space R. Such 
transition do esn’t add much sense to risk assessment but helps simplify the comparison of 
risk assessments made by different rating agencies. We suggest take the next step and 
introduce continuous numerical risk grades. Usage of continuous risk grades substantially 
changes the role and the meaning of agents risk assessment.

continuous risk grades for economic theory. 
2.2 Risk motion 
Many risks impact economic evolution. We don ’t consider particular risks and propose that 
one can chose 1, 2, 3 risks that impact economic agents and economic processes. For 
convenience we describe economy under action of n risks, n=1,2 ,.. The absolute values of 
continuous risk grades are subject of the convenience of use. We chose continuous risk 
grades x that f ill the interval [0,1]  of space R. We take the 0 as the most secure and 1 as the 
most risky grades. Thus assessment of agents risk 𝑥 ∈ [0,1]  for the single risk distribute all 
agents over interval [0,1]. Assessments of agents ratings for n risks distribute agents over unit 
cube in Rn. Let ’s assume that at moment t there are N(t) agents in the economy and 
assessments of n risks for all agents i=1,…N(t)  define risk ratings xi of agent i (2.1): 
𝒙𝒊=(𝑥1𝑖, … 𝑥 𝑛𝑖);     0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑗𝑖≤ 1 ;    𝑖 = 1, . . 𝑁 (𝑡);    𝑗 = 1, … 𝑛   (2.1) 
Risk ratings xi (2.1) of agent i play role of coordinates in economic domain (2.2): 
𝒙 = (𝑥1, … 𝑥 𝑛)  ;     0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑗≤ 1 ;       𝑗 = 1, … 𝑛  ;    𝒙 ∈ 𝑅𝑛   (2.2) 
For decades major rating agencies present distribution of largest banks and corporations by 
their risk ratings (Bangia, Diebold and Schuermann, 2000; Pompliano and Hancock, 2002 ; 
Volland, et.al. 2019). We suggest disseminate this practice on all economic agents in the 
economy. Actually it is common economic practice now. Rating agencies distribute banks by 
credit ratings and each bank provides credit ratings of its clients. Almost all agents are  clients 
of banks now and hence credit ratings now are already assessed for almost all agents. We 
only suggest use the unified methodology for risk assessment and make current practice to 
assess bank client ratings publicly available. Distribution of economic agents by their risk 
ratings x as coordinates in economic domain (2.2) establishes distributions of their economic 
and financial variables by the risk coordinates in economic domain (Appendix A).  Moreover, 
distribution of agents by their continuous numerical risk ratings x in economic domain (2.2), 
introduces velocities υ of agents motion in domain (2.2). Motion of agents in the space of risk 
ratings introduces hidden and important properties of economic processes that impact the 
evolution of economic state and determine the nature of business and credit cycles in 
particular. Indeed, any economic activity of agents itself and various economic and financial 
processes, technological or political trends, any factors that impact economic development 
induce change of agent risk ratings. As we mentioned above, rating agencies evaluate risk 
transition matrices (Metz and Cantor, 2007; Moody ’s, 2009;  Fitch, 2017; S&P, 2018 ) for ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,risk many  for t    assessments r risk for ba die bold ser manplia no hancock vland  aually rati almost  distribut omotined as metz cantor moody pitch

"," 8 largest banks and corporations. Elements aij of transition matrices describe the probability aij 
that agent with risk rating xi will move to rating xj during certain time term T. As usual 
interval T equals one, two or three years. At present the risk ratings are denoted by letters. 
We suggest replace letter risk grades by continuous numerical risk grades. This replacement 
permit determine the distance between risk rating xi and xj. Indeed, for numerical continuous 
grades the transition from rating xi to xj defines interval lij : 
𝒍𝑖𝑗= 𝒙 𝑗− 𝒙 𝑖      (2.3) 
Transition from xi to xj takes time T and hence defines the velocity υij of the agents motion 
from xi to xj during time T as: 
𝒗𝑖𝑗=𝒍𝑖𝑗
𝑇      (2.4) 
Element aij of transition matrices define probability aij of motion from xi to xj with velocity υij 
during time T. Hence transition matrix defines mean velocity υ(t,xi) of agent at point xi as:

𝑗=1   ;   ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝐾
𝑗=1 = 1   (2.5) 
Here K means the number of different numerical risk grades that defines the degree KxK of 
the transition matrix. Motion of agent i in economic domain (2.2) causes that agent i caries its 
economic and financial variables with velocity υi. Collective effect generated by transport of 
economic and financial variables by individual agents during their risk motion in economic 
domain (2.2) establishes important and influential factor that impact macroeconomic 
evolution. Let ’s consider this in more details. 
2.3 Collective economic behavior 
Economics is a social phenomenon. Description of economic processes requires description 
of collective economic behavior of individual agents. Agents risk assessment and distribution 
of individual agents by their risk ratings as coordinates in economic domain (2.2) establish 
the way for description of agents collective economic behavior and help develop continuous 
economic media approximation. The main reason for such approximation is the transition 
from description of economic and financial variables as properties of individual agents to 
description of distributions of economic and financial variables as functions of risk 
coordinates in economic domain (2.2). To evaluate such a transition one should rougher the 
description of agents coordinates. In simple words, if one has a meter ruler with divisions of 
millimeters, than to rougher the description one should aggregate millimeter scales in each 
centimeter division of the ruler and leave only centimeter divisions at the ruler. The new ruler 
measures the distance with less accuracy. Let ’s do the similar and rougher description of ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,elements as at   ined transitelement nce re motcolleive  colleive economics sipt t to it

"," 9 agents in economic domain (2.2). For n risks and n-dimensional economic domain (2.2) l et’s 
chose a scale d such as: 
  0 < 𝑑 < 1    ;   𝑑𝑉 (𝒙)~𝑑𝑛         (2.6) 
Let’s assume that at point x a small volume dV(x) contains a lot of agent s i with coordinates 
xi inside the volume dV(x). Let’s take additive economic or financial variable Ai(t,x) of agent  
i inside the volume dV(x) with risk coordinates x (2.1) and risk velocity υi(t,x) (2.5). As 
variable A one can consider agents assets, investment, credits, profits and etc. Let ’s sum 
values of variable Ai(t,x) of all agents i with risk coordinates x inside volume dV(x) (2.6). 
Actually all economic assessments, measurements and observations take certain time term Δ. 
As Δ one can consider minute, hour, week, month and etc. Time interval Δ determine internal 
time scale of the continuous economic approximation – all variations of economic variables 
or processes described by this particular approximation take time t> Δ. Let’s chose such time 
term Δ and averaged sum of agents variable Ai(t,x) inside the volume dV(x) during the 
interval Δ (A.1, A.2). We call the sum of values of variable Ai(t,x) of all agents i with risk 
coordinates x inside small volume dV(x) (2.6) averaged during the interval Δ as the collective 
variable A(t,x) (2.7):

of point x in the domain (2.2) but not the properties of individual economic agent. The same 
procedure defines other additive economic variables. It is obvious, that integral by dx over

variables Ai(t,x) of all agents i in the economy ( E) averaged during time term Δ. Definition 
(2.7) of economic variable A(t,x) gives intermediate approximation between description of 
variable Ai(t,x) of individual agent i and description of macroeconomic variable A(t) (2.8) as 
sum over all agents in the economy. Such intermediate approximation uncovers hidden 
processes that impact economic evolution and are almost neglected by current 
macroeconomic models.

"," 10 (2.2). To explain our statement l et’s chose variable Ai(t,x) of agent i at point xi at moment t. 
Agent i moves in economic domain (2.2) with velocity υi(t,x) (2.5). It is said that product 
Ai(t,x)υi(t,x) describes the flow piA(t,x) (A.4) of the variable Ai(t,x) that agent i carries with 
velocity υi(t,x). Different agents i carries different flows piA(t,x) of variable Ai(t,x) with 
different velocities υi(t,x) (2.5) . Collective transport of economic variable Ai(t,x) by all agents 
inside volume dV(x) averaged during interval Δ determines the collective flow PA(t,x) (A.5): 
𝑷𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)=∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝝊𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙); ∆ =  𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)𝝊𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)        (2.9) 
of the collective variable A(t,x) (2.7) with the collective velocity υA(t,x) (2.9). Different 
economic variables A(t,x), B(t,x), C(t,x) define different flows PA(t,x), PB(t,x), PC(t,x) (2.9) 
with different velocities υA(t,x), υB(t,x), υC(t,x). Relations and interactions between variables, 
flows and their velocities establish harsh environment for macroeconomic modeling. 
Relations (2.10) cause that macroeconomic variable A(t) (2.8) moves in the economic domain 
with the velocity υA(t). Indeed, if one takes integral (A.6) by PA(t,x) (2.9) over economic 
domain (2.2) or sum the product Ai(t,x)υi(t,x) by all agents i in the entire economy E than one 
derives macroeconomic flow PA(t) (2.10) of economic variable A(t) (2.8): 
𝑷𝐴(𝑡)= 𝐴 (𝑡)𝒗𝐴(𝑡)=∫𝑑𝒙 𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)𝒗𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)   (2.10) 
Relations (2.10) determine very important notion: the motion of macroeconomic variable A(t) 
with the velocity υA(t) in economic domain (2.2). Velocity υA(t) cause change of new 
important economic notion υA(t) - the mean risk XA(t) (A.7) of economic variable A(t,x). We 
introduce the mean risk  XA(t) (A.7) of economic variable A as sum of products xi A(t,xi) for 
all agents in the economy (A.7) weighed by variable A(t) and averaged during interval Δ: 
𝑿𝐴(𝑡)𝐴(𝑡)=∫𝑑𝒙 𝒙 𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙) =1

Risk assessment of economic agent i determines its risk coordinates x in economic domain 
(2.2). The notion XA(t) (A.7) solves the problem of mean risk associated with economic 
variable A. Different economic variables have different impact on economic evolution. To 
assess risks of entire economy one should assess risks related with economic variables. 
Continuous numerical risk grades open the way for introducing the mean risks of economic 
variables. As we show below dynamics of mean risks of economic variables in economic 
domain (2.1, 2.2) describes phases of business cycles. Econometrics and observation of mean 
risks may help reduce financial crises losses and develop more sustainable economic policy. 
Relations (2.11) define the mean risk XA(t) of related with economic variable A(t) (2.8) that is 
somewhat similar to VWAP (Berkowitz et.al 1988; Buryak and Guo, 2014; CME Group,

"," 11 variables define different mean risks. Mean risk XI(t) of investment I(t) in the economy is 
different from mean risk XC(t) of credits C(t), or mean risk XD(t) of demand D(t),  or mean 
risk XVA(t) of value added VA(t) and etc. Agents economic activity, regulatory, political, 
technology variations change agents risk coordinates and hence change mean risks of 
macroeconomic and financial variables. Below we present a simple model that describe the 
motion of variable A(t) with velocity υA(t) in economic domain (2.2) and corresponding 
motion of the mean risk XA(t) with different velocity. (App.C.). Borders of economic domain 
(2.2) of a unit cube in Rn limit change of the mean risks of any economic variable. Hence 
motion of mean risk XA(t) of any economic variable A(t) should fluctuate from secure to risky 
areas of economic domain (2.2) and back. These slow oscillations of mean risks of 
macroeconomic variables reflect slow change of mean risks of economic variables in the 
economy. Interrelations between different economic and financial variables cause 
correlations between motion of different mean risks and establish a complex picture of 
macroeconomic evolution. Economics is a complex system with strong backward 
interactions. The change of mean risk s XA(t) impact change of value of macro variable A(t) or 
vice versa. Thus oscillations of the mean investment risk from secure to risky area in 
economic domain (2.2) and back can describe the macroeconomic investment cycles from 
low to high investment activity and then back to low. Credit cycles follow the fluctuations of 
mean credit risks and etc. Growth of economic activity and rise of demand should be 
accompanied with motion of demand mean risk from secure to risky area in (2.2). We state 
that cyclical motions of mean risks of economic variables in economic domain (2.2) reflect 
essence of business and credit cycles and express the nature of economic and financial crises. 
Variety of factors those impact motion of mean risks, mutual interactions between 
macroeconomic variables and their flo ws, other reasons that define properties of oscillations 
of mean risks in economic domain (2.2) establish a complex dynamics of business cycles and 
economic crises. Each new one will be different from the previous but all such events are 
accompanied by cycles of mean risk in economic domain.  
In App.C we present a simple model of business cycle. In the next Section we study 
processes that determine change of macroeconomic and financial variables. 
3. Collective transactions 
The conventional economic models describe mutual dependence of macroeconomic 
variables. For example the change of demand causes the change of supply, variations of cost 
of capital causes the change investment activity and etc. Of course, these economic “laws” 
are correct, but they reflect indirect relations between macroeconomic variables. The only ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,mea below app borrs rnce tse interpatns economics t  edit groh  variety eaiapp isecolleive t for of t

"," 12 processes those have direct effects on change of economic and financial variables are 
described by market deals, trades, transactions between economic agents. Only trading goods, 
commodities, currencies, assets, capital, funds, service and etc., change agents economic and 
financial variables and hence impact the change of macroeconomic variables. Any variation 
of market regulation, tax policy, custom decisions , the spread of information on rise or fall of 
demand or supply, financial markets or national currency, and etc., take economic effect if 
and only after the deals, trades, and transactions between agents are executed. Only market 
trading impacts economic growth, price trends, cause business cycles or approaching crisis. 
Deals and trades are the only direct drivers of the economic development. All other economic 
factors, economic trends, financial policy, market information, forecasts and etc., forms 
agents expectations and these expectations impact agents decisions to take or reject trades, 
deals and transactions. For sure agents expectations take effect on trade decisions but only 
executed transactions establish records for the change of economic variables. Description of 
trades is the only way to understand the hidden rules, reasons and effects of economic 
processes. 
To describe trades between agents and model collective impact of transactions on economic 
processes let ’s take into account the same factors we use to descri be collective impact of 
agents economic and financial variables. Agents perform transactions with different assets, 
commodities, currencies and etc. Let ’s chose trades with particular commodities or assets and 
study only this type of transactions. Let ’s assume that agent i at point x sells the volume Uij 
of selected assets, commodities or service, etc. that we denote as variable A to agent j at point 
y and agent j pays the value Cij for the for the volume Uij of selected variable A. As variable A 
one can consider securities, commodities, gold, crude oil, any specific assets, investment and 
etc. We define the buy-sell transaction bsij between agents i and j as two-component function 
(3.1): 
𝒃𝒔𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝑈 𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛); 𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)) ;  𝒛 = (𝒙, 𝒚)    (3.1) 
Risk coordinates x and y of agents i and j involved into trade bsij (3.1) define economic 
domain (3.2; 3.3) as unit cube with dimension 2n in R2n:

involved into the trade and the value Cij change the amount of funds of agents i and j. In real

"," 13 can be executed in different moments but for simplicity we assume that the deals bsij (3.1) 
with the volume Uij and the value Cij are performed simultaneously. Precise description of 
transactions between individual agents is almost impossible. Indeed, any attempt to collect 
exact information about transactions of all agents simply can destroy the market and disturb 
economic environment. Thus one should replace exact description of the transactions bsij 
(3.1) between individual agents i and j by description of collective trades of agents alike to 
description of collective economic variables A(t,x) (2.7). To do that we take (2.6) and 
introduce small volume dV(z) in economic domain (3.2; 3.3):  
𝑑𝑉(𝒛)= 𝑑𝑉 (𝒙)𝑑𝑉(𝒚)  ;  𝑑𝑉 (𝒙) ~𝑑𝑛   ;    𝑑𝑉 (𝒚) ~𝑑𝑛   (3.4)

involved into trade bsij (3.1) with variable A. We aggregate the volumes Uij and the values Cij 
of all trades between sellers inside dV(x) and all buyers inside dV(y) and average it during 
time term Δ. Thus we replace description of trades bsij (3.1) between individual agents i and j 
by description of collective transactions BS(t,z) (B.2-B.4 ) at point z=(x,y)  of economic 
domain (3.2; 3.3).

agents inside dV(x) and dV(y) averaged during interval Δ. As we mentioned above, economic 
activity of agents and variations of economic environment cause change of agents risk 
coordinates. Seller i and buyer j involved into transaction bij (3.1) move in economic domain 
and this motion cause flows pijU of the volume Uij and flows pijC of the value Cij of the trade 
bij (B.5-B.8). Collective flows of the volume Uij and the value Cij between all agents inside 
volume dV(x) and volume dV(y) and averaged during interval Δ defines the flow P(t,z) (B.9-
B.17) of the collective transaction BS(t,z). Flow P(t,z) describes the transport of the collective 
volume U(t,z) and collective value  C(t,z) of the trade BS(t,z) with velocity υ(t,z).

trades with crude oil are different from flows and velocities of trades with gold, cupper, 
wheat and etc. Aggregations of transactions performed between sellers and buyers in the 
entire economy define the collective macroeconomic transaction BS(t), its flow P(t) and 
velocity υ(t) in domain (3.2; 3.3). Similar to motion of macroeconomic variable A(t) with 
velocity υA(t) in economic domain (2.2) flow P(t) and velocity υ(t) describe collective 
transport of the macro transaction BS(t) induced by risk motion of sellers and buyers (B.21-

and the total value C(t) (B.22) of all transactions BS(t) in the economy averaged during 
interval Δ. It is important to emphasize that risk motions of sellers involved into transaction 
BS(t) induce macro flows PxU(t) (B.27) of the volume U(t) along axis X and risk motions of 
buyers induce flows PyU(t) (B.28) of the volume U(t) along axis Y in economic domain. The

PxU(t), PyU(t) and the value PxC(t) and PyC(t) have different velocities and the agents motion is 
limited by borders of economic domain (3.2, 3.3). Thus velocities of the volume υxU(t), υyU(t) 
and the value υxC(t) and υyC(t) (B.32) should fluctuate and change direction from secure to 
risky area of the domain (3.2, 3.3) and back. Motions of the volume U(t) and the value C(t) of 
transactions BS(t) (3.8) have similar nature as motions of economic variables. Similar to 
mean risk XA(t) of variable A(t) (2.11) transactions BS(t) (3.5, 3.8) define mean risk XU(t) of 
the volume U(t) and mean risk XC(t) of the value C(t) (B.33-B.36). We introduce mean risk

"," 15 4. Fluctuations of the mean risks – the nature of business cycles 
Economics is a complex mixture of numerous processes with direct and backward 
interactions and constraints. The objective of theoretical economics is the development of 
successive approximations of real economic processes. Any approximation simplifies the 
economic reality. We chose the risk assessment as the tool for distributing agents by 
economic domain and describe the motion of economic variables and market transactions as 
definite approximation of real economic processes. We regard the fluctuations of the mean 
risks XA(t) of economic variable A(t) as the core essence of cycle evolution. The cycles of the 
credits and investment, demand and production function are accompanied by and described 
by fluctuations of the corresponding mean risks. The mean risk XA(t) of variable A(t) change 
its value from secure to risky area of economic domain and back. Along with the motion of 
mean risk the corresponding variable A(t) changes from growth to stagnation, then decline 
and so on . It is common knowledge that in secure state agents economic activity is low, but 
agents preferences and desires move them take the risky decisions under risky expectations 
and execute the risky transactions. That increases agents economic activity but moves them 
to more risky area of economic domain. Different agents act differently in same risk 
conditions. Aggregation of their collective economic activity, aggregation of agents variables 
and transactions smooth description of the individual agents dynamics and presents 
description of collective economic behavior. Description of collective agents activity 
establishes collective flows of agents variables and transactions. Flows of variables and 
transactions determine fluctuations of mean risks of collective motion in economic domain. 
The factors that govern the mean risk fluctuations in economic domain, the exogenous or 
endogenous “shocks ” that initiate the motion of mean risks from secure to risky area of 
economic domain or back can be different. Each new business cycle differs from the previous 
one. We emphasize that any business cycle, any cyclical change of economic g rowth to 
stagnation and economic decline are accompanied by the mean risk motion. Description of 
mean risk motion gives approximation of the business cycles. 
4.1. Risk motion equations 
Evolution of collective economic variables and transactions determine the mean risk motion. 
To reduce the complexity of the current paper we omit here description of collective 
expectations and refer to (Olkhov, 2019b; 2019c) for modeling the collective expectations, 
their flows and their impact on transactions. However we confirm that methods presented in

"," 16 To simplify further description and introduce the self-consistent business cycle model we 
reduce our study by equations on collective economic variables A(t,x) (2.7) (Olkhov, 2016; 
2017; 2018a) . As variable A(t,x) (2.7) one can consider collective investment, credits, assets 
and etc., of agents with risk ratings near x. Let’s take arbitrary small volume dV in economic 
domain (2.2). The change of variable A(t,x) in a volume dV during time dt is determined by 
two factors. The first one describes the change in time of A(t,x) during dt in a volume dV :

𝜕𝑡𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)     (4.1) 
The second factor is determined by the flows PA(t,x)=A(t, x)υA(t,x) (2.9) of agents that may 
flow in- or flow out- through the surface of small volume dV during time dt. Agents that flow 
in- a volume dV during dt increase the amount of variable A in a volume dV. Agents that flow 
out of the surface of volume dV decrease the amount of variable A inside volume dV. Total 
change of variable A in volume dV due to in- and out- flows PA(t,x) (2.9) takes form of 
surface integral:

Integral in (4.2) is taken by the surface of volume dV. The well-known Gauss' Theorem 
(Strauss 2008, p.179) states that the surface integral by the flow equals the volume integral by 
divergence of the flow and thus (4.2) takes form: 
∮𝑑𝑠  𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)𝒗 𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)=∫𝑑𝑉  ∇ ∙ (𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)𝒗 𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙))   (4.3) 
Hence total change of variable A in arbitrary small volume dV equals sum of (4.1) and (4.3): 
∫𝑑𝑉 [ 𝜕
𝜕𝑡𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)+ ∇ ∙ (𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)𝒗𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙))]    (4.4) 
As volume dV is arbitrary small hence the change of variable A(t,x) at point x takes the form:

"," 17 agents in the economic domain. These flows describe new factors that impact economic 
evolution and have not been considered in standard mainstream models before. Integral of 
equation (4.5) by dx over economic domain (2.2) gives ordinary differential equation on 
variable A(t) (2.8):   
𝑑
𝑑𝑡𝐴(𝑡)= 𝐹 𝐴(𝑡) ;   𝐹 𝐴(𝑡)=∫𝑑𝒙 𝐹 𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)     (4.7) 
Equation (4.7) is a consequence of (4.3): there are no economic agents outside of domain 
(2.2) (Olkhov, 2016; 2017; 2018a; 2018b). Hence all flows outside (2.2) equal zero. Thus 
integral in (4.3) by any surface that include domain (2.2) equals zero. Simplicity of equation 
(4.7) hides complex dependence of function FA(t) on variables, transactions and expectations 
and their flows. Similar considerations permit derive equations on flows PA(t) (2.10) of 
variable A(t) (2.8).

Flows (2.9, 2.10) of variables and transactions and mean risks (2.11) and their functions were 
never taken into account as factors that impact evolution of macro variables A(t) (4.7). Above 
consideration highlights the hidden complexities of economic and business cycle modeling. 
To avoid excess complexity in this paper we don ’t consider here equations on transactions 
and refer to (Olkhov, 2018b; 2019a; 2019b; 2019c) for further details.  
4.2. The model of the supply-demand cycle 
We present the simple model of supply S(t) and demand D(t) cycles accompanied by 
fluctuations of mean supply risk Xs(t) and mean demand risk Xd(t) in 1-dimensinal economic 
domain [0,1] that describes economic processes under action of a singe risk (App.C). As such 
a risk one may consider credit risk, inflation risk or any single risk that impact 
macroeconomics. We take into account interactions between supply and demand only and 
neglect impact of all other economic variables, transactions and expectations to make the 
model equations as simple as possible. Such simplification allows formulate self-consistent 
equations that describe mutual interaction between supply and demand and derive simple 
solutions that describe fluctuations of supply, demand and their mean risks. We consider 
supply-demand cycle in the linear approximation by disturbances of supply and demand. In 
the linear approximation by disturbances we derive equations that describe oscillations of 
supply and demand disturbances and equations that describe fluctuations of supply and 
demand mean risks. Even this toy model of supply and demand interactions emphasize 
relatively complex dynamics of supply and demand mean risks. Oscillations of supply s(t) ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,tse integral equat nce  simplicity simar funns flows above to  t  xs  app as  su ieveosclatns

5. Conclusion 
Relations (4.9-4.11) describe cycles of the supply s(t) and the demand d(t) disturbances 
accompanied by fluctuations of the mean supply risk xs(t) and the mean demand risk xd(t) 
disturbances with the same frequency ω. Time derivative of the supply s(t) disturbances (C.9) 
depends upon factor D0υdx(t) that models the product of risk x and flow of demand 
disturbances D0υd(t,x) integrated by economic domain. The similar product of risk x and flow 
of supply disturbances S0υs(t,x) integrated by economic domain (C.10) impact time derivative 
of demand disturbances  d(t).  Such factors that impact time derivatives of supply and demand 
were not studied before in business cycle models. One may probably object that the 
simplicity of the model assumptions doesn ’t fully reflect economic reality of the observed 
supply and demand cycles. It would be surprising if the real supply-demand cycle can be 
described by pure analytical expressions (4.9-4.11) without taking into account numerous 
factors that define impact of macroeconomic environment. Our consideration of the 
macroeconomic modeling and business cycles in particular demonstrate the complexity of the 
economic processes. A uniform approach to description of business cycles requires 
development of the successive approximations. W e intentionally simplified the cycle model 
equations to underline the main advantages of our approach. We highlight that any business 
cycle that is driven by any reasons and that describes fluctuations of any macro variables is 
characterized by the mean risk fluctuations. Cycles of investment, economic growth, supply-
demand cycle and etc., are characterized by fluctuations of corresponding mean risks. In our 
simple model the mean risk fluctuations are induced by fluctuations of supply and demand 
velocities. In reality the relations between fluctuations of flows, fluctuations of macro 
variables and their mean risks may be more complex, but flows play the core role in any 
business cycles. Nevertheless relations between risk ratings migration and the business cycle 
were studied at least for twenty years (Bangia, Diebold and Schuermann, 2000) our proposal ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z, app conusrelatns time t suone it our  cyiinevertless ba die bold ser mann

"," 19 for usage of continuous numeric risk grades gives a new look on meaning of ratings 
migration matrices and their role in business cycles.  
In the conclusion we collect the main issues of our approach to description of the business 
cycle. The initial is the proposal to use continuous numerical risk grades as meters for risk 
ratings assessments. We chose that risk grades take value inside economic domain - a unit 
cube with most secure grade equals 0 and most risky equals 1. The second – assumption that 
risk assessments can be performed for almost all economic agents.  If so, well-know risk 
transition matrices determine velocities of agents motion in economic space. To smooth 
irregular and complex picture of millions of economic agents identified by their risk 
coordinates, risk velocities and numerous economic and financial variables and market 
transactions between agents we introduce continuous economic approximation. We define 
collective variables, transactions and their flows aggregated by all agents inside small volume 
dV in economic domain and averaged during time interval Δ. We derive equations alike to 
equations of continuous media, those describe evolution of economic variables, transactions 
and their flows. Any flows inside a bounded economic domain (unit cube) should fluctuate 
from secure to risky area. These fluctuations of flows cause business cycles. Integrals by 
equations over economic domain give ordinary equations on time derivatives for collective 
variables, transactions and their flows as functions of time only. Such a long road to simple 
ordinary time derivatives discovers new economic factors – collective flows, velocities, mean 
risks and etc., those impact macroeconomic and business cycle dynamics. We present pure 
theoretical considerations. Econometric data that may support or reject our model doesn ’t 
exist. However we hope that our results will help develop risk assessment and econometrics 
to obtain reasonable and adequate approximations of complex economic processes and 
business cycles.   ",2020-12-08T15:45:11Z,it  t  to   any tse integrals su econometric ver

Economic variables, their flows and mean risks 
We model economy as set of economic agents involved in numerous market transactions 
under action of n risks. Economic agents are described by their risk ratings as coordinates 
x=(x 1,…x n) on n-dimensional economic domain (2.1, 2.2). Agent i with coordinates (t,x) has 
additive variables Ai(t,x) like investment, demand, profits and etc. The purpose of our 
approximation – move description of variables Ai(t,x) as properties of individual agents to 
description of collective variables A(t,x) as functions of coordinates (t,x). To do that  let’s take 
certain time interval Δ and chose a unit volume dV(x) (2.6). Let ’s collect variables Ai(t,x) of 
agents inside dV(x) (2.6) and average the sum during interva l Δ. We define variable A(t,x) as: 
𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)=∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙); ∆      (A.1) 
∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙); ∆ ≡1
∆∫ 𝑑𝜏𝑡+∆/2
𝑡−∆/2 ∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝜏, 𝒙)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)   (A.2) 
𝑖 ∈ 𝑑𝑉 (𝒙) denotes that agent i belong to a unit volume dV(x) (2.6). Time averaging smooth 
changes of A(t,x). Integral by economic domain (2.1, 2.2) of A(t,x) (A.1) defines A(t) (A.3): 
𝐴(𝑡)=∫𝑑𝒙  𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)      (A.3) 
Relations (A.3) define the sum of variable A(t,x) (A.1) over all agents in the economy 
averaged during interval Δ. Agents economic activity and evolution of the economic 
environment cause change of agents risk ratings and define velocities υ=(υ 1,…υ n) of 
economic agents (2.3-2.5). Agent i with velocity  υi carries variable Ai(t,x) in economic 
domain (2.1, 2.2) and creates agent ’s flow piA(t,x) (A.4) of variable Ai(t,x): 
𝒑𝑖𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙) = 𝐴 𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝝊 𝒊(𝑡, 𝒙)      (A.4) 
We define collective flow PA(t,x) of variable A(t,x) as sum of agents flows (A.2, A.4) 
averaged during interval Δ: 
𝑷𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)=∑ 𝐴𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝝊𝑖(𝑡, 𝒙)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙); ∆ =  𝐴 (𝑡, 𝒙)𝝊𝐴(𝑡, 𝒙)       (A.5) 
Relations (A.5) allow present flow PA(t,x) as product of variable A(t,x) (A.1) and collective 
velocity υA(t,x). Integral of (A.5) by (2.1, 2.2) define macroeconomic flow PA(t) as product of 
variable A(t) (A.3) and macroeconomic velocity υA(t) in economic domain as: 
𝑷𝐴(𝑡)=∫𝑑𝒙 𝑷 𝑨(𝑡, 𝒙)= 𝐴 (𝑡)𝝊𝐴(𝑡)     (A.6) 
Function A(t,x) permit introduce mean risk XA(t) as risk of all economic agents weighted by 
variable Ai(t,x) and averaged during interval Δ. Sum in (A.7) is taken by all agents 𝑖 ∈ 𝐸  in

"," 24 Appendix B 
Market transactions, their flows and mean risks 
We describe trades between agents. Agent i at point x sells the volume Uij of variable A to 
agent j at point y and agent j pays the value Cij to agent i. As a variable  A one may consider 
commodities, credits, investment, assets, service and etc. We define transaction bsij(t,x,y) 
between agents i and j at points x and y, z=(x,y) as:  
𝒃𝒔𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝑈 𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛); 𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛))   ;   𝒛 = (𝒙, 𝒚)    (B.1) 
We move from description of transactions as relations between agents and introduce 
transactions as functions of point z=(x,y) in economic domain (3.2, 3.3). We define collective 
transaction BS(t,z) as sum of transactions between of agents i inside small volume dV(x) and 
agents j inside volume dV(y) (3.4) and average the sum during interval Δ alike to (A.1, A.2): 
𝑩𝑺(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝑈 (𝑡, 𝒛); 𝐶(𝑡, 𝒛))    ;     𝒛 = (𝒙, 𝒚)    (B.2) 
𝑈(𝑡, 𝒛)=∑ 𝑈𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙);𝑗∈𝑑𝑉(𝒚); ∆   ;    𝐶 (𝑡, 𝒛)=∑ 𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)𝑖∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙);𝑗∈𝑑𝑉(𝒚); ∆   (B.3)

Economic activity of sellers and buyers, evolution of economic environment change risk 
coordinates of agents involved into transactions. That causes flows of transactions alike to 
flows of economic variables (A.4-A.6). Seller i with risk velocity υix carries flow pUijx of 
volume Uij(t,z) along axis X and buyer j with risk velocity υjy carries flow pUijx volume Uij(t,z) 
along axis Y. Motion of agents i and j along axes X and Y define the flows of volume Uij(t,z) 
and value Cij(t,z) as 
𝒑𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝒑 𝑈𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛), 𝒑𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛))      (B.5) 
𝒑𝑈𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝒑 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑥(𝑡, 𝒛); 𝒑 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑦(𝑡, 𝒛)) ;  𝒑 𝐶𝑖𝑗(𝑡, 𝒛)= (𝒑 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑥(𝑡, 𝒛); 𝒑 𝐶𝑖𝑗𝑦(𝑡, 𝒛))  (B.6)

Appendix C 
The model of supply-demand cycles 
We study the cycles of macroeconomic supply S(t) and demand D(t) under action of single 
risk in the 1-dimensional economic domain [0,1]. We present model of self-consistent 
interaction between small dimensionless disturbances of supply s(t,x)  and demand d(t,x) near 
stationary state in the linear approximations by perturbations. We take supply S(t,x)  and 
demand D(t,x) : 
𝑆(𝑡, 𝑥)= 𝑆 0(1 + 𝑠 (𝑡, 𝑥)) ;    𝐷 (𝑡, 𝑥)= 𝐷 0(1 + 𝑑 (𝑡, 𝑥))  (C.1) 
|𝑠(𝑡, 𝑥)|≪ 1   ;   |𝑑(𝑡, 𝑥)|≪ 1     ;     0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1  
Supply S(t,x)  and demand D(t,x)  and their flows PS(t,x)=S(t,x)υ s(t,x) and PD(t,x)=D(t,x)υ d(t,x) 
follow equations similar to (4.5, 4.6):

𝐹𝑃𝑆(𝑡, 𝑥)  (C.3) 
We propose that velocities of supply υs(t,x) and demand υd(t,x) are small. We assume that 
interactions between supply and demand in linear approximation by disturbances take form: 
𝐹𝐷(𝑡, 𝑥) ~ 𝑎𝐷 0 𝑥𝑣 𝑑(𝑡, 𝑥)  ;   𝐹 𝑆(𝑡, 𝑥) ~ 𝑏𝑆 0 𝑥 𝑣 𝑠(𝑡, 𝑥)    (C.4)

by 1-dimensional scalar product of risk coordinate x and demand flow D0υd(t,x). This models 
the impact of the demand flow in economic domain on evolution of supply disturbances 
s(t,x) . If υd(t,x)>0 then right side (C.6) describes demand flow in the direction of risk growth 
that cause growth of supply s(t,x). Negative υd(t,x)<0  models demand risk aversion and cause 
decline of supply s(t,x).  Equation (C.7) models similar impact of the 1-dimensional scalar 
product of risk coordinate x and supply flow S0υs(t,x) on demand disturbances d(t,x) . Right 
side in (C.6; C.7) models direct impact of risk coordinate x on supply and demand. Equation 
(C.7) describes linear mutual relations between supply and demand flows. Positive demand 
flow with υd(t,x)>0  cause growth of supply flow S0υs(t,x) and negative demand flow with 
υd(t,x)<0 results in decline of supply velocity υs(t,x). Coefficient α>0 describes the effect of 
these relations. Equation of demand flow (C.7) models the similar relations but with the 
opposite sign of the coefficient β<0. Growth of supply flow S0υs(t,x) reduce demand d(t,x) 
and decline of supply flow cause increase of demand. Equations (C.8) describe mutual 
dependence between velocities of supply and demand in the linear approximation by 
disturbances. We show below that equations (C.1; C.6-C.8) describe the cycles of supply s(t) 
and demand d(t) that are accompanied by fluctuations of mean risk of supply Xs(t) and mean 
risk of demand Xd(t).

or the unit cube in Rn for n risks as the economic domain. We consider risk
ratings of economic agents as their coordinates in the economic domain.
Economic activity of agents, economic or other factors change agents risk
ratings and that cause motion of agents in the economic domain. Aggregations of
variables and transactions of individual agents in small volume of economic
domain establish the continuous economic media approximation that describes
collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain as
functions of risk coordinates. Any economic variable A(t,x) defines mean risk
XA(t) as risk weighted by economic variable A(t,x). Collective flows of
economic variables in bounded economic domain fluctuate from secure to risky
area and back. These fluctuations of flows cause time oscillations of
macroeconomic variables A(t) and their mean risks XA(t) in economic domain and
are the origin of any business and credit cycles. We derive equations that
describe evolution of collective variables, transactions and their flows in the
economic domain. As illustration we present simple self-consistent equations of
supply-demand cycles that describe fluctuations of supply, demand and their

"," 2 I. Introduction 
This paper presents Econophysics approach to macroeconomics and develops parallels 
between description of multi particle systems and macroeconomic multi agent systems. 
Such approach is well known in Econophysics and there are many applications of 
methods of statistical physics, kinetics and hydrodynamics to description of economic 
systems [1-8]. As well there exist definite misunderstanding of Econophysics models 
by economic and financial researchers [9,10]. Indeed fundamental distinctions between 
economic and physical systems make direct applications of physical methods for 
economic modeling not too effective. Nevertheless certain parallels between economic 
and physical systems may allow use language of physics to develop economic theory 
on base of pure economic and financial issues.  
We develop model of macroeconomics that is based on pure economic notions with 
help of some parallels between economics and physics. The core issues of our approach 
concern introduction of economic space [11-13] that allow describe multi agent 
economic systems alike to multi particle systems in physics. For decades international 
rating agencies estimate risk ratings of corporations and banks. These risk ratings help 
take Investment decisions, determine credit policy and avoid losses due to default. We 
propose that risk assessment methodologies and practice can be developed in such a 
way that can provide risk ratings for all economic agents of economic and finance 
system. Such “simple” assumption requires tough efforts and development of risk 
methodologies and risk econometrics. It requires cooperation of risk agencies and 
market authorities, banking and financial regulators, businesses and Government 
Statistical Bureaus, academic and business researchers, etc. Let assume that all 
econometric and regulatory problems can be solved and risk ratings can be provided on 
a regular basis for all economic agents: for huge banks and international corporations 
and for small companies and households. How that can help for economic modeling? 
We propose that risk ratings of economic agents allow establish f irst “parallel” between 
economics and physics – introduce coordinates of economic agents [11-13]. Risk 
ratings take values of risk grades that can be treated as points of certain discreet space. 
Let treat risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on such a space. That 
distributes all economic agents by their coordinates and develops parallels to 
description of particles in physics . Let assume that risk assessment methodology can be ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z,introdu eco no psics sueco no psics as eco no psics ined nevertless  t for tse investment  suit government statistical bureaus  how  risk  that

"," 3 extended and define continuous risk grades like points on R. Then one can plot 
economic agents by their risk ratings as coordinates on continuous space. Let call such 
a space determined by risk grades as economic space and define it’s d imension by 
number of risks measured simultaneously.  
Distribution of numerous economic agents by their risk ratings as coordinates on 
economic space presents a model alike to  multi-particle systems in physics. There are 
at least two distinctions that underline vital differences between economic and physical 
systems. Almost all classical physics problems are described by systems of particles 
those have only few properties like mass and electric charge. Contrary to that, 
economic agents or economic particles as we call them further, have enormous number 
of economic and financial variables like Capital and Value, Demand and Supply, 
Assets and Debts, Investment and Credits, Production Function and Wages and etc. 
Aggregations of economic and financial variables define macroeconomic and macro 
financial variables. Modeling relations between numerous macroeconomic variables 
define subject of economic theory. Economic particles (economic agents) have tens of 
economic and financial variables and that increase variety and complexity of economic 
system modeling to compare with description of multi-particle systems in physics.  
Second essential distinction between physical and economic systems concern type of 
interactions between particles in physics and interaction between economic agents. 
Physics is based on local type of interactions – particle 1 interacts with particle 2 when 
coordinates are nearly the same. Economic and financial interactions are completely 
different. For example, economic agent with coordinates x can Sell goods, attract 
Investment, Buy resources, receive Loans from economic agents with coordinates y on 
economic space. Thus economic agent with coordinate x on economic space can carry 
out economic or financial transaction with economic agent with any coordinate y on 
economic space. Thus economics presents wonderful examp le of “action -at-a-distance”  
interactions between agents on economic space but we shall not argue any “parallels  
to” Mach’s principle and etc. We simply highlight complete distinctions between 
economic and physical systems and present economic model in “terms” that are alike to 
kinetics and hydrodynamics. In [11-13] for simplicity we presented macroeconomic 
models that describe dynamics of macroeconomic variables in the assumption that 
transactions between economic agents are local . In other words we assumed that ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z,t distributtre almost contrary capital value mand supply assets s investment edits produfunwagaregatmoli economic second psics economic for sell investment buy loans   ma iin

"," 4 economic transactions between agents on economic space occurs for agents with nearly 
same coordinates only. Such simplifications allow use parallels to local  interaction 
between physical particles and describe interaction between macroeconomic variables 
by simple differential operators [13]. In this paper we develop macroeconomic model 
that takes into account non- local “action -at-a-distance” transactions bet ween agents on 
economic space. 
It is wonderful that economic theory already has certain model of “action- at-a-
distance”  interactions between economic agents. Nearly eighty ears ago famous 
economist Wassily Leontief developed Input-Output Analysis or inter-industry Tables 
framework [14-18]. In his Nobel Lecture Leontief [16] expressed key issue of input-
output framework as: “Direct interdependence between two processes arises whenever 
the output of one becomes an input of the other: coal, the output of the coal mining 
industry, is an input of the electric power generating sector ”. Thus Leontief’s inter -
industry Tables describe “action- at-a-distance” transactions between economic agents 
those belong to different industries. In this paper we suggest a simple thing: let 
substitute distributions of economic agents by industries with distributions of economic 
agents by their risk ratings as points of economic space. That can allow use Leontief’s 
ideas presented by inter-industry Tables and develop a model of “action- at-a-distance” 
transactions between economic agents that have different coordinates on economic 
space. Description of economic and financial transactions between agents on economic 
space gives description of corresponding macroeconomic variables. Thus we can obtain 
model of evolution of macroeconomic variables determined by “action- at-a-distance” 
transactions between economic agents. To describe dynamics of these transactions we 
derive hydrodynamic-like equations. These equations permit describe interactions 
between different economic and financial transactions and for simple models of such 
interaction derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For such simple 
models of interaction between economic transactions we derive wave equations on their 
perturbations. Dynamics of any complex systems should be accompanied by complex 
wave generations, propagations and interactions. Our model presents evidence that 
macroeconomics and finance also governed by a wide range of macroeconomic wave 
processes on economic space. ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z,suiit easy leotie input output analysis tablinobel leure leotie dire  leotie tablithat leotie tablsipt to tse for dynamics our

"," 5 We present pure theoretical treatment of macroeconomics. Up now no econometric 
data that can verify or reject predictions of our macroeconomic model exist. Current 
risk assessment data provided by risk rating agencies are not sufficient to develop 
macroeconomic models on economic space. We do hope that enhancement of risk 
assessments procedures, econometric observations and data performance can improve 
economic modeling, forecasting and management.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce of n-
dimensional economic space. In Section III we reconsider Leontief’ s input-output 
framework and introduce economic fields that describe transactions  between economic 
agents at different points on economic space. In Section IV we describe economic 
fields by hydrodynamic-like equations. In Section V for simple two conjugate  Credits-
Loans and Payments- on-Credits economic fields interaction model we derive 
hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. In Section VI we derive wave equations 
on economic field disturbances. Conclusions are in Section VII. 
II. Definition Of Economic Space 
Description of multi-agent system alike to multi-particle system requires economic 
analogy of physical space that allows define coordinates of economic agents similar to 
coordinates of physical particles. We suggest use risk ratings of economic agents as 
their coordinates on economic space. Definition of economic space was presented in 
[11-13] but we repeat it briefly here for convenience. 
International rating agencies [19-21] estimate risk ratings of economic agents as Banks 
and Corporations, Firms and Enterprises. Risk ratings take values of risk grades and 
noted as AAA, BB, C  and so on. Let treat risk grades like AAA, BB, C  as points x1, x2,.. 
xm of discreet space. Let propose, that risk assessments methodologies can estimate risk 
ratings for all agents of entire economics: for huge Banks and for small households. 
That will distribute all economic agents of the entire economics over points of finit e 
discreet space determined by set of risk grades. There are a lot of different risks those 
impact economic processes. Let regard grades of single risk as points of one-
dimensional space and simultaneous rating assessments of n different risks as 
measurements of coordinates of economic agent on n-dimensional space. Let propose, ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z, up current  t iseiseleotie iseiseedits loans payments edits iseconusns senitof economic space sipt nitinternatnal banks coratns rms enterprisrisk   banks that tre

"," 6 that risk assessments methodologies can be generalized in such a way that risk grades 
can fill continuous space R. Thus risk grades of n different risks establish Rn. 
Let define economic space as any mathematical space that map economic agents by 
their risk ratings as space coordinates. Number of risks ratings measured 
simultaneously determines dimension of economic space. Let put positive direction 
along each risk axis as risk growth direction. Let assume that all economic agents of 
entire economics are “independent” and thus sum of extensive (additive) economic 
variables of any subset of agents equals economic variable of the entire subset. For 
example, sum of Assets of any two “independent” economic agents equal their 
collective Assets. Let assume that econometric data provide info about risk ratings and 
economic variables of each economic agent. These assumptions require significant 
development of current econometrics and statistics. Quality, accuracy and granularity 
of current U.S. National Income and Product Accounts system [22] give hope that all 
these problems can be solved.  
It is obvious that there exist a lot of different economic and financial risks those affect 
evolution of economic agents. It is impossible to take into account all possible risks. To 
develop reasonable economic theory one should select some major risks and neglect 
minor risks. Definition of economic space Rn requires selection of n risks with major 
impact on economic agents and macroeconomic processes. These n risks define initial 
state of economic space Rn. Selection of most valuable risks requires procedures that 
allow measure and compare influence of different risks on entire economics and 
economic agents. Assessment and comparison of different risks and their influence on 
economic agents establish tough problems and such models should be developed. Risk 
assessments methodologies and procedures, comparison of risk influence on 
performance of economic agents and on macroeconomic dynamics can establish 
procedures alike to physical measurement theory. It may help develop relations 
between economic theory on economic space, econometric data and economic statistics 
similar to interdependence between theory and measurements in physics. Solution of 
this problem requires close collaboration between physicists and economists. 
Economic and financial risks have random nature and can unexpectedly arise and then 
vanish. Thus some current risks that define initial representation of economic space Rn 
can accidentally disappear and other different risks may come to play. Thus economic ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z, r number   for assets assets  tse quality natnal income produ accounts it it to nitrtse rseleassessment risk it soluteconomic  r

"," 7 space representation can be changed randomly. Description of economic dynamics and 
financial forecasting for time term T requires prediction of m main risks that can play 
major role in a particular time term and can define economic space Rm. Such set of m 
risks determine target state of economic space Rm. Transition of economic modeling on 
initial economic space Rn to target economic space Rm requires description of decline of 
action of initial set of n risks on entire economics and description of growth of 
influence of new m risks. Such stochastic scenarios are completely different from 
physical models that study complex dynamics of random fields and particles 
determined on constant physical space.    
Current macroeconomics describes relations between macroeconomic variables as 
Demand and Supply, Production Function and Investment, Economic Growth and 
Consumption each treated as function of time. Introduction of economic space gives 
ground for definition of macroeconomic variables as functions of time and coordinates . 
This small step opens doors for wide application of mathematical physics methods and 
models that should b e transformed to adopt economic and financial phenomena’s.  
Below we present macroeconomic model on economic space Rn in the assumption that 
economic agents are under action of constant set of n risks. We describe 
macroeconomics alike to kinetics and hydrodynamics and derive hydrodynamic-like 
and wave-like equations. Up now notions of waves in economics and finance are used 
to describe Kondratieff waves [23], inflation waves, crisis waves, etc. All these issues 
don’t describe any waves but time oscillations of economic variables only. Description 
of waves requires space. Introduction of economic space gives ground for development 
of economic wave theory and establishes ground for unified approach to various 
economic problems. Economic space gives new look on option pricing theory and 
allows describe Markov processes on economic space [11,12]. In this paper we develop 
macroeconomic model with “action -at-a-distance”  interactions between economic 
agents on economic space. For brevity let further call economic agents as economic 
particles or e-particles and economic space as e-space.

"," 8 i with coordinates x and e-particle j with coordinate y as economic field aij(x,y). These 
economic fields describe exchanges of Resources, Commodities, Energy, Assets, 
Profits, Liabilities etc. between e-particles. Eighty years ago W. Leontief [14 ] 
developed input-output analysis that describe inter-industry resources exchange. Let 
consider core issue of his approach: “the output of one becomes an input of the other” 
as any economic or financial transactions between e-particles on e-space. 
Each e-particle has many economic and financial variables like Demand and Supply, 
Assets and Liabilities, Credits and Loans, etc. Leontief’s ideas allow define economic 
fields between any two e-particles. Let call economic or financial variables of two e-
particles as mutual  if “the output of one becomes an input of the other”. For example, 
Credits as output of Banks are mutual  to Loans as input of Borrowers. Assets are output 
of Investors are mutual  to Liabilities as input of Debtors. Let call any exchange 
between e-particles by mutual  economic or financial variables as action of 
corresponding economic field between them. Different mutual  economic or financial 
variables interact by different economic fields. Let define that economic field a1,2(x,y) 
between e-particle 1 at point x and e-particle 2 at point y describes exchange by 
economic variables Bin(1,x) and Bout(2,y) at moment t. Let a1,2(x,y) be output economic 
variable Bout(2) from e-particle 2 to e-particle 1 and a1,2(x,y) input of economic variable 
Bin(1) of e-particle 1 from e-particle 2 at moment t. So, a1,2(x,y) describes speed of 
change of economic variable Bin(1,x) of e-particle 1 due to exchange with e-particle 2 
and a1,2(x,y) describes speed of change of economic variable Bout(2,y) of e-particle 2 
due to exchange with e-particle 1. Then economic variable Bin(1,x;y) of e-particle 1 
changes due to action of economic field a1,2(x,y) with e-particles at point  y as follows:

determined by pairs of mutual  economic variables like Credits and Loans, Sales and 
Purchases, Assets and Liabilities, etc. Let assume that all extensive economic variables 
can be described by Eq.(1.1,1.2) or through other mutual  economic variables. Thus we 
assume that economic fields describe dynamics of all extensive economic variables of 
e-particles and hence describe dynamics and evolution of macroeconomics and finance. 
IV. Hydrodynamic-Like Model Of Economic Fields 
This Section describes economic fields of e-particles on e-space alike to kinetics and 
hydrodynamics [24,25]. Let assume that economic fields between e-particle at point x 
and e-particle at point y are determined by exchange of mutual  economic variables like 
Assets and Liabilities, Credits and Loans, Buy and Sell, Demand and Supply and so on. 
Different economic fields describe action between different mutual  economic variables. 
For example, if e- particle “one” at point  x gets Loan (input) of amount cl from e-
particle “two” at point y then e- particle “two” at point  y at time t provides a Credit 
(output) of amount cl (Credit-Loans)  to e- particle “one” at point x. Thus function 
cli,j(t,x,y) on 2n-dimensional e-space describes Credit-Loans  economic field or Credit-
Loans  transaction between e-particle i at points x and e-particle j at point y. That is 
similar to treatment of economic variable cl of e-particles on 2n-dimensional e-space 
and allows develop parallels to kinetics and hydrodynamics. Let study Credit-Loans  
(CL) economic field model. 
A. Macroeconomic variables 
Macroeconomics describes interdependence between macroeconomic variables like 
GDP, Assets, Credits, Taxes, Consumption ant etc. Each macroeconomic variable is 
composed of economic variables of economic agents (e-particles). For example, 
macroeconomic Asset s are determined as sum of Assets of all “independent” e -
particles. Introduction of e-space allows define macroeconomic variables as functions 
of time and coordinates. Thus mutual interdependence between macroeconomic 
variables can be described as relations between functions on e-space with help of 
methods that have parallels to mathematical and statistical physics. We introduced e-
space densities of macroeconomic variables in [13] and give it briefly here for ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z,for value value coratbank edits loans salpurchasassets liabiti eq  dro dynamic like mof economic elds  se assets liabitiedits loans buy sell mand supply dferent for loaedit edit loans  edit loans edit loans that  edit loans maoeconomic maoeconomic assets edits taxconsumpteafor asset assets introdu

"," 11 macroeconomic variables and their densities is determined by transactions between e-
particles. For example macroeconomic Credits C(t,y) at point y are determined by 
transactions of Credits that are provided from e-particles at point y to e-particles at 
point x. Paper [13] describes relations between macroeconomic densities for local  
approximation that takes into account only transactions between e-particles with same 
coordinates near point x. In other words we describe transactions between e-particles 
with nearly same risk ratings only. Such simplification is alike to  local interaction 
between physical particles and allow describe interaction between macroeconomic 
variables U(t,x) and V(t, x) on e-space by differential operators [13].  
Real economic processes are determined by economic and financial transactions 
between e-particles with any different coordinates x and y – any different risk ratings x 
and y. In other words e-particles with coordinate x (risk rating x) can Buy-Sell, Credits-
Loans, Investment-Liabilities and etc., with e-particles with coordinate y. Such “action -
at-a-distance” transactions between e -particles at points x and y describe complex 
interdependence between macroeconomic variables U(t,x) and V(t, y) that can not be 
described by differential operators as in [13]. To describe relations between 
macroeconomic variables in the approximation that takes into account “action -at-a-
distance” properties of transactions between e -particles on e-space one should define 
macroeconomic transactions densities – economic fields – alike to Eq.[2.1-2.3].  
B. Macroeconomic transactions and economic fields

words, if e-particle i at point x increases it’s Loans by cli,j(x,y) due to Credits from e-
particle  j at point y at moment t then e-particle particle  j at point y provides Credit 
cli,j(x,y) at moment t to e-particle i at point x. Let state that cli,j(x,y) define Credit-Loans 
economic field between e-particles at points x and y. That exactly reproduce Leontief’s

Economic fields may describe many important economic properties. For example, 
Assets-Liabilities economic field AL(z=(x,y)) describes distribution of speed of Assets 
allocations from point y as function of x. For given x economic field AL(z=(x,y)) 
describes speed of Liabilities changes at point x as function of y on e-space Rn. Due to 
Eq.(1.1-1.2) integral of economic field density AL(x,y) by y over e-space Rn defines 
speed of change of total Liabilities at point x. Integral by x over e-space Rn determines 
speed of change of total Assets at point y. Similar distributions can be obtained for 
Credits-Loans economic field CL(x,y). It describes distributions of Credits provided 
from point y to point x at moment t. Such economic fields allow describe transactions 
by mutual  economic and financial variables like Assets and Liabilities, Credits and 
Loans etc., and study other economic problems. For example economic fields can 
describe dynamics of maximum of Credits allocations at point x=x(t) on e-space or 
distance between position of maximum source of Credits and position of maximum 
Loan borrowers on e-space. Economic fields like CL(t, x,y) are functions of two

"," 14 modeling economic fields as functions on e-space. Below we derive hydrodynamic-like 
equations to describe Credits-Loans CL(t, z=(x,y)) economic field model. 
C. Hydrodynamic-Like Approximation of Economic Fields 
Economic field CL(t, x,y) and impulses P(t,x,y) are determined by Eq.(3.1-3.5) as mean 
values of transactions between e-particles at point x and y. Economic fields similar to 
CL(t, z=(x,y)) can describe mutual  variables as Credits and Loans, Buy and Sell, 
Demand and Supply and so on. That allow regard economic fields on 2n-dimensiona l 
e-space R2n similar to economic variables densities on e-space Rn [11-13] and alike to 
mass density distribution ρ(t,x) in physical kinetics [24] . We use term “alike” to 
underline vital differences between nature of physical kinetics and hydrodynamics on 
one hand and properties of economic variables and economic fields on the other hand. 
We state absence of direct analogies between description of economic and physical 
systems. Nevertheless we derive hydrodynamic-like equations on economic fields.  
Let define economic field A(x,y) between two mutual  economic variables Ain(x) and 
Aout(y) on e-space Rn. A(x,y) equals output Aout(y) from point y and equals input Ain(x) at 
point x at moment t. Functions A(t,z=(x,y)) and υ(t,z=(x,y))=(υX(t,z)),υY(t,z))) are 
determined on  2n-dimensional e-space R2n. Let regard economic field A(t,z) as 
economic density [11-13] on 2n-dimensional e-space R2n. Continuous Equations (4.1) 
and Equations of Motion (4.2) on A(t,z) take form:

ܣ [𝜕࢜
𝜕௧+ሺ࢜ ∙ ∇ ሻ࢜] = ࡽ ଶ    (4.2) 
Left side of Eq.(4.1) describes the flux of density A(t,z) through surface of unit volume 
on e-space R2n and Q1 describes factors that change A(t,z). Economic field A(t,z) can 
change in time and during motion of the selected volume on e-space due to economic 
reasons. Left side of Equation of Motion describes flux of impulse density  P(t,z) = 
A(t,z)υ(t,x) through unit volume surface on e-space R2n. If one takes into account 
Continuity Equation then for simplicity left side of Equation of Motion takes (4.2.) Q2 
describes factors that change density A(t,z) and velocity  υ (t,z).

"," 15 e-space. These models were based on assumptions that economic variables of e-
particles at point x depend on conjugate  economic variables at same point  x of e-space. 
We assumed local  transactions between e-particles and hence local  interaction of 
macroeconomic variables of e-particles on e-space. It is obvious that assumption on 
local  transactions between e-particles or transactions between e-particles with same 
coordinates only simplifies macroeconomic model and neglect economic and financial 
transactions between e-particles with different coordinates. Nevertheless such 
simplification allows develop “simple ” description of macroeconomic variables and 
derive wave equations on e-space for variables disturbances. Even such simplified 
model discovers extreme diversity and complexity of possible behavior of 
macroeconomic variables on e-space [11,13].  
Meanwhile, real economic relations are much more complex. E-particles at point x on 
e-space can exchange by economic and financial transactions with e-particles at any 
other point y on e-space. Thus economic variables of e-particles and macroeconomic 
variables of entire economics at point x depend on conjugate  economic variables at 
different points on e-space. This is alike to action of certain economic  fields  that 
describe transactions of economic variables between points x and y on e-space. For 
example, economic field CL(t, x,y) between points x and y describes Credits provided 
from e-particles at point y to e-particles at point x at moment t. Such economic field 
CL(t, x,y) describes how Loans at point x depend on Credits from point y on e-space at 
moment t.  
To derive economic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic fields in a closed form 
let study interaction between economic fields. Let define conjugate  economic fields 
alike to conjugate  economic variables [11,13]. Let state that economic field A(t,z) 
depend on other economic fields or economic variables that are different form mutual  
variables that define A(t,z). Let denote economic field B(t,z) as conjugate  to economic 
field A(z) if B(z) or their velocities determine right hand side factors Q1 and Q2 of 
hydrodynamic-like Eq.(4.1- 4.2). Any economic fields can have one, two or many 
conjugate  economic fields that determine right hand side of Eq.(4.1-4.2). For example, 
Credits-Loans economic field may depend on Payments-on-Credits economic field, 
Demand-on-Investment, Buy-Sell transactions that require additional funds and etc.

V. Two Conjugate Economic Fields Model 
To derive Eq.(4.1-4.2) in a closed form let study simple model of mutual dependence 
between two conjugate  economic fields as Credits-Loans CL(z) and Payments-on-
Credits PC(z). Let define Payments-on-Credits PC(z=(x,y) ) economic field as all pay 
offs to e-particles at point y that are made by e-particles from point x due to Loans  they 
received from e-particles at point y. Thus Payments-on-Credits economic field 
PC(z=(x,y)) describes income flow of e-particles at point y received at moment t from 
e-particles at point x. Economic field CL(z=(x,y)) describes Credits provided from e-
particles at point y to e-particles at point x at moment t. Credits-Loans CL(z) and 
Payments-on-Credits PC(z=(x,y) ) economic fields describe important properties of 
macroeconomics and finance. These economic fields are responsible for economic 
growth and financial sustainability and their descriptions are extremely complex. 
Introduction of e-space allows establish and study various models that describe 
interactions between economic variables and economic field s and different 
approximations of real economic and financial processes.  
Let start with simple model and assume that Credits-Loans economic field CL(t, z) at 
moment t depends on Payments-on-Credits economic field PC(t,z=(x,y) ) at moment t 
only. Our assumption means that Creditors, like Banks at point y take decisions to 
provide Credits to point x on base of Payments-on-Credits from point x to point y at 
moment t. Such assumption simplifies the problem but allows develop reasonable 
model of their mutual interdependence.  
To describe evolution of Credits-Loans field CL(t, z) let define factors Q1 and Q2 of 
Eq.(4.1-4.2). Let assume that Q1 on the right hand side of Continuity Equation (4.1) for

VII. Conclusions 
Introduction of e-space establishes certain parallels between description of economic 
and physical systems and opens wide opportunities for application of statistical and 
mathematical physics methods for macroeconomic modeling. As well strong 
distinctions between nature of physical and economic systems requires complete 
reformulation of common of models but allow development of kinetic-like and 
hydrodynamic-like macroeconomic models. 
All macroeconomic variables are determined by corresponding variables of economic 
agents. Economic and financial transactions between economic agents define 
interactions and interdependence between macroeconomic variables. Economic and 
financial transactions can occur between economic agents with different risk ratings or 
different coordinates x and y on economic space. That outlines “action -at-a-distance” 
character of transactions on economic space. It is great that certain model of such non-
local transactions was developed by W.Leontief nearly 80 years ago and is known in 
economics as input-output inter-industry tables framework. Leontief’s  ideas allow

conjugate  economic fields can be described by local  hydrodynamic-like equations on 
economic space. To show advantages of such approach to macroeconomic modeling 
we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form for interactions between 
Credits-Loans and Payment-on-Credits economic fields. These equations admit 
derivation of wave equations for economic field disturbances alike to derivation of 
acoustic equations in hydrodynamics. Description of generation, propagation and 
interaction of economic field waves can be important for forecasting of macroeconomic 
variables and can help for macroeconomic policy-making. Macroeconomic variables as 
Demand and Supply, Investment and GDP, Assets and Liabilities and etc., can be 
described as functions on economic space and corresponding economic fields describe 
their evolution. Modeling and forecasting of macroeconomic dynamics requires 
development of economic field models on economic space. Complexity of 
macroeconomic relations and diversity of economic processes that are described by 
economic fields interactions on economic space leave few chances for adequate 
modeling by “mainstream” general equilibrium, DSGE, decision making, game 
theories and etc. [26-30]. Further development of macroeconomic and economic fields 
interactions models on economic space requires close collaboration of physicists and 
economists. 
Economic space notion is a core issue of our approach. Introduction of economic space 
as generalization of risk ratings of economic agents permit describe economic agents 
by their coordinates on economic space. Economic agents can move on economic space 
alike to particles and that cause changes of macroeconomic variables. Such 
interpretation helps develop bridge between description of macroeconomics as set of 
economic agents and description of multi-particles systems. Nature of economic 
phenomena is completely different from physical phenomena. Economic space is 
determined by set of most valuable risks and has different representations for different 
set or major risks. Random properties of risk nature cause random changes of economic ",2017-02-09T09:36:46Z, that suintns to edits loans payment edits tse siptmaoeconomic mand supply investment assets liabitimoli lexity furtr economic introdueconomic sunature economic random

"," 22 space representation. Thus it seems impossible to develop deterministic 
macroeconomic forecast as random nature of risks growth and decline insert permanent 
uncertainty into macro dynamics and modeling on economic space. Possibility to 
measure and select most valuable risks may establish procedure to validate the initial 
and target set of risks and to prove or disprove initial model assumptions. It makes 
possible to compare predictions of economic and financial models with observations 
and helps outline causes of disagreement between theoretical predictions and 
macroeconomic reality. 
Development of macroeconomic models on economic space need appropriate 
econometric foundations that are absent now. Our model is pure theoretical as there are 
no econometric data that can verify or reject predictions of our theory. Verification 
requires development of risk assessment of economic agents and collecting data on 
economic and financial transactions between them. Risk assessment methodologies 
should be extended to provide risk ratings for all economic agents, for huge 
corporations and banks with billions dollars assets and for small householders with few 
thousands dollars income. Risk assessment methodologies should allow introduce risk 
grades – points of economic space - that can establish discreet space or continuous 
space R as well. That requires collective efforts of Central Banks and Economic 
Regulators, Rating Agencies and Market Authorities, Businesses and Government 
Statistical Bureaus, Academic and Business Researchers, etc. Econometric foundations 
that are required for studies of Leontief’s input -output inter-industry tables were 
successfully established . We do hope that problems required for macroeconomic 
modeling on economic space can be solved also and that diversity and complexity of 
problems aroused on economic space may be interesting for physicists.

"," 2 1.Introduction 
Econophysics during last decades made a lot for economic and financial modeling [1-
8]. Financial markets and price dynamics, market trends and crises forecasting, 
market strategies, risk and insurance assessment use methods and models of 
theoretical and statistical physics. Meanwhile deep distinctions and 
misunderstandings between languages of economics and finance on one hand and 
theoretical physics on other hand [9] prevent mutual beneficial development. In this 
paper we try to overcome at least part of these distinctions and develop 
macroeconomic theory based on notions of economics and finance with help of 
certain parallels to kinetics and hydrodynamics.  
We agree with statements [6] that direct applications of physical models and methods 
to economic and financial problems give no effect. Distinctions between economic 
and physical systems are so vital that physic al methods should be completely 
reconstructed to be useful for economic modeling. We hope that variety of new 
problems that should be solved to establish economic theory in a rigorous form alike 
to current state of theoretical physics should be interesting to physicists. As well we 
do hope that ou r models may present new treatment of economic and financial 
problems and deliver benefits for econometrics, economic modeling and forecasting. 
Perfect treatments of existing problems in economic theories are presented in 
numerous works of leading economists as Morgenstern [10 ], Lucas [11], Lucas and 
Sargent [12], Sims [13], Blanchard [14], McCombie and Pike [15]. These papers 
should be ground for any econophysics study. We do hope that our model might 
respond some of them.  
We develop economic theory on base of two common economic notions: economic 
agents and risk ratings of economic agents. Agent-based models argue decision-
making of economic agents, describe trading strategies, game theories, behavioral 
economics, equilibrium theory [16-21]. Economic agent is a general term that 
describes any participant of economic o r financial relations like Companies and 
Firms, Banks and Exchanges, Privet Investors and Households and etc. It is assumed 
that economic agents take rational or non rational decisions, follow personal 
expectations, develop and maintain its market strategy and that should explain 
behavior of economic agents – Producers and Consumers, Investors and Borrowers 
and etc.  ",2017-01-20T12:36:57Z,introdueco no psics nancial meanw i distinns  as fe morgensterlucas lucas argent sims blanchard mc pike tse   agent economic anirms banks exriinvestors households it producers consumers investors borrors

"," 3 We avoid discussions about agent’s strategies and their decisions and propose regard 
economic agents as primary, simple units of macroeconomic alike to  particles in 
kinetic models in physics. Let treat economic agents like simple economic particles 
that have many economic variables that describe Demand and Supply, Investment and 
Production Function of economic agents and so on. Such approach to agent-based 
models allows develop bridge between language of economic modeling and language 
of physics and develop parallels between description of economic multi-agent system 
and description of physical multi-particle system.  
All macroeconomic variables are composed by corresponding variables of economic 
agents. Macroeconomic Demand is determined by aggregation of Demand of separate 
economic agents. Value Added of economic agents [22] define GDP of entire 
economics. Macroeconomic Consumption, Investment, Credits and Profits – all 
macroeconomic variables are determined by corresponding variables of separate 
economic agents. That is alike to relations between physical properties of macro 
system and physical properties of particles that constitute this macro system. There is 
no need to repeat that properties of agent-based economic system and physical multi-
particle system are completely different. We outline parallels between them only.  
To develop similarities between economic multi-agent system and multi-particle 
physical system one should define certain economic analog of space that can allow 
describe economic agents alike to multi-particle systems in physics. Moreover, such 
economic space should have origin and roots in economics and finance and adopt 
general economic relations and phenomena’s . Usage of space in economics usually 
refers to spatial economics [23, 24], but that approach is helpless. To develop 
parallels between multi-agent and multi-particle systems we introduce economic 
space notion [25, 26] that reflects internal economic properties and allows develop 
general frame to macroeconomic and macro finance modeling. Economic space 
approach gives new look on option pricing theory and we derived generalization of 
Black-Scholes-Merton equations on n-dimensional economic space [25, 26, 27]. In 
this paper we describe macroeconomic multi-agent systems on n-dimensional 
economic space. We develop parallels to kinetics and hydrodynamics nevertheless 
phenomena’s of economic agent  system s have nothing common with nature of 
kinetics and hydrodynamics of multi-particle physical systems.  
We propose use risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic 
space. Risk ratings of economic agents are provided for decades by international ",2017-01-20T12:36:57Z,  mand supply investment produfunsuall maoeconomic mand mand value add maoeconomic consumptinvestment edits prots that tre  to ousage to economic  schools mortoi  risk

"," 4 rating agencies as Fitch’s [28], S&P [29], Moody’s [30]. Risk agencies define risk 
ratings of huge corporations and banks. These ratings are used as measure of assets 
security, sustainability and helps take investment decisions, estimate market prices of 
assets and etc. Risk ratings take finite number of values or risk grades. Let propose 
that risk ratings can be measured for all economic agents. Let assume that risk grades 
can be discreet as it is now or can be continuous R. Let call discreet or continuous 
space of risk grades as economic space. Let propose that simultaneous assessment of 
n different risks determine coordinates of economic agents on n-dimensional 
economic space. These assumptions allow describe macroeconomics alike to  
description of multi-particle systems and derive hydrodynamic-like equations on 
economic space. 
Our macroeconomic model is pure theoretical as no econometric data requi red to 
verify predictions of our theory exist. Current risk ratings data are not sufficient 
develop macroeconomic models on economic space. We do hope that required 
enhancement of risk assessments, econometric observations and data performance can 
improve economic modeling, forecasting and management.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce economic 
space and discus related economic and physical problems. In Section 3 and 4 we 
present kinetic-like and hydrodynamic-like economic models. In Section 5 we study 
simple interactions between two macroeconomic variables that allow derive 
hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and derive wave equations on 
macroeconomic perturbations alike to acoustic equations in fluids. Simple example in 
Section 6 demonstrates how waves can induce time fluctuations of macroeconomic 
variables. Derivation of acoustic-like wave equations is not too interesting for 
theoretical physics papers but as we know it is the first evidence and description o f 
wave processes in macroeconomic and financial models. In Section 7 we argue 
diversity of macroeconomic models and some open problems that can be interesting 
for physicists. Conclusions are in Section 8.

"," 5 suggest risk ratings of economic agents [25, 26]. Here we present brief reasons for 
economic space definition.  
International rating agencies [28-30] estimate risk ratings of economic agents as 
Banks and Corporations, Firms and Enterprises. Risk ratings take values of risk 
grades and noted as AAA, BB, C  and so on. Let treat risk grades like AAA, BB, C  as 
points x1, x2,.. x m of discreet space. Let propose, that risk assessments methodologies 
can estimate risk ratings for all agents of entire economics: for huge Banks and for 
small households. If so, risk ratings distribute all economic agents of the entire 
economics over points of finite discreet space determined by set of risk grades. There 
are a lot of different risks those impact economic processes. Let regard grades of 
single risk as points of one-dimensional space and simultaneous assessments of n 
different risks as coordinates of economic agent on n-dimensional space. Let propose, 
that risk assessments methodologies can be generalized in such a way that risk grades 
can fill continuous space R. Thus risk grades of n different risks establish Rn. 
Let define economic space as any mathematical space that map economic agents by 
their risk ratings as space coordinates. Number n of risks ratings measured 
simultaneously determines dimension n of economic space. Let put positive direction 
along each risk axis as risk growth direction. Let assume that all economic agents of 
entire economics are “independent” and sum of extensive (additive) economic 
variables of any subset of agents equals economic variable of the entire subset. For 
example, sum of Assets of any two economic agents equal their collective Assets. Let 
assume that econometric data contains data about risk ratings and all economic 
variables of each economic agent. These assumptions require significant development 
of current econometrics and statistics. Quality and granularity of current U.S. 
National Income and Product Accounts system [22] gives hope that all these problems 
can be solved.  
Definition of economic space as grades of all economic and financial risks arises 
additional tough problem. There are a plentiful number of different economic and 
financial risks but their influence on macroeconomic evolution is very different.

"," 6 and macroeconomic processes. These n risks define initial state of economic space Rn. 
Selection of most valuable risks requires procedures that allow measure and compare 
influence of different risks on entire economics and economic agents. Assessment and 
comparison of different risks and their influence on economic agents establish tough 
problems and such models should be developed. Risk assessments methodologies and 
procedures, comparison of risk influence on performance of economic agents and on 
macroeconomic dynamics can establish procedures alike to  physical measurement 
theory and measurement procedures. It allows develop relations between economic 
theory and econometric statistics alike to interdependence between physical theory 
and experimental measurements. Solution of this hard problem requires close 
collaboration between physicists and economists. 
Economic and financial risks have random nature and can unexpectedly arise and then 
vanish. Thus some current major risks that define initial representation of economic 
space Rn can accidentally disappear and other major risks may come to play. Thus 
economic space representation can be changed randomly. Description of economic 
dynamics and forecasting for time term T requires prediction of m main risks that can 
play major role in a particular time term and can define economic space Rm. Such set 
of m risks determine target state of economic space Rm. Transition of economic 
modeling on initial economic space Rn to target economic space Rm requires 
description of decline of action of initial set of n risks on entire economics and 
description of growth of influence of new m risks. Such stochastic scenarios are 
completely different from physical models that study complex dynamics of random 
fields and particles determined on constant physical space.    
Current macroeconomics describes relations between macroeconomic variables as 
Demand and Supply, Production Function and Investment, Economic Growth and 
Consumption each treated as function of time. Introduction of economic space gives 
ground for definition of macroeconomic variables as functions of time and

3. Macroeconomic kinetic s  
Let treat macroeconomics as set of economic agents on economic space. Economic 
agents can move on economic space alike to  particles. For convenience let call 
economic agents as economic particles or e-particles and economic space as e-space. 
Let assume that each e-particle is described by l extensive (additive) economic 
variables (u1,…u l) as Supply and Demand, Production Function and Capital, 
Consumption and Value and etc . Let study macroeconomics on e-space Rn that 
reflects action of constant set of n risks. Risk ratings of e-particles play role of their 
coordinates on e-space Rn. 
Each e-particle on e-space Rn at moment t is described by coordinates x=(x 1,…x n), 
velocity υ=(υ 1,… υ n), and extensive economic variables (u1,…u l). Extensive economic 
variables of economic agents are additive and admit averaging by probability 
distributions. Intensive economic variables, like Prices or Interest Rates, cannot be 
averaged directly. Enormous number of extensive variables like Value and Capital, 
Demand and Supply, Profits and Savings, Consumption and Investment etc., describe 
economic and financial performance of each e-particle and are origin of extreme 
complexity of economic system s. As usual, macroeconomic variables are defined as 
aggregates of corresponding values of all economic agents of entire macroeconomics. 
For example, Demand of entire macroeconomics equal aggregate Demand of all 
economic agents and GPD can be calculated as aggregate Value Added of all 
economic agents [22]. Let introduce macroeconomic variables as aggregates of 
corresponding values of economic agents with coordinates x on e-space.  
Let assume that there are N(x) e-particles at point x. Let state that velocities of e-
particles at point x equal υ=(υ 1,… υ N(x)). Let describe economics that has l 
macroeconomic variables and hence each e-particle has l economic variables (u1,…u l). 
Let assume that values of economic variables equal u=(u 1i,…u li), i=1,..N( x). Each 
extensive economic variable uj at point x defines macroeconomic variable Uj as sum 
of economic variables uji of N(x) e-particles at point x

f=f(t, x;U1,..U l, P1,..Pl) on n-dimensional e-space that determine probability to observe 
macroeconomic variables Uj and impulses Pj at point x at time t. Uj and Pj are 
determined by corresponding values of e-particles that have coordinates x at time t. 
They take random values at point x due to random behavior of e-particles on e-space. 
Averaging of Uj and Pj within distribution function f allows establish transition from

Densities Uj(t,x) and impulses Pj(t,x) are determined as mean values of aggregates of 
corresponding economic variables of separate e-particles with coordinates x. 
Functions Uj(t,x) can describe macroeconomic e-space density of Demand and 
Supply, Assets and Debts, Production Function and Value Added and so on. Usage of 
distribution function f=f(t, x;U1,..U l, P1,..Pl) allows describe any statistical moments of 
macroeconomic variables like <U jm>, correlations between economic variables

interaction of macroeconomic densities Ui(t,x) and we state no economic parallels to 
such physical factors as pressure or viscosity. Let state that right hand side factors Q1

growth. Interest Rate growth induce decline of Demand on Investment. Let neglect all 
other factors that have influence on Investment Demand and Interest Rate and 
simplify relations between core macro financial variables to obtain equations (4,5) in

averaging procedure (1-3) to extensive (additive) variables of e-particles only. 
Intensive macroeconomic variables are determined as proportionality factor for 
relations between two extensive macroeconomic variables. Thus macroeconomic 
Interest Rate ir(t,x) determine proportionality factor between Cost of Investment

establish a model with two interacting conjugate  e-fluids Demand for Investment

To derive macroeconomic wave equations on base of (6.1-6.2) let take small 
perturbations qI of Demand on Investment UI and small perturbations qC of constant 
Cost of Investment densities UC and assume that velocities υI and υC are small. Let 
put: 
𝑈𝐼= 𝑈 𝐼଴+ ݍ 𝐼  ; 𝑈 𝐶= 𝑈 𝐶଴+ ݍ 𝐶    (7.1) 
and assume that derivations of UI0 and UC0 by time and coordinates in Eq.(6.1-6.2) are 
small to compare with similar derivations of qI , qC, υI and υC so we can neglect 
derivations by UI0 and UC0. In hydrodynamics similar approximations are used to 
derive acoustic wave equations [34]. Continuity Eq.(6.1) on small perturbations qI,C in

These examples demonstrate possible exponential amplification or dissipation of 
wave amplitudes of small macroeconomic perturbations in model of two interacting

Nevertheless even for simple model equations on disturbances of economic densities 
take form of bi-wave Eq.(8.2) and Green function for such bi-wave equations equals 
convolution of Green functions of two wave equations. Thus even simplest response 
on δ-function shock in economics is more complex then in physics. Existence of wave 
processes on e-space allows describe macroeconomic wave generation, propagation 
and interaction as possible wave response on macroeconomic shocks. Amplitudes 
amplifications of macroeconomic perturbations waves may model macroeconomic 
and financial crises evolution.  
6. Time fluctuations of macroeconomic variables 
 All economic variables follow time fluctuations and often these fluctuations 
are called waves [31, 35, 36]. Meanwhile all these “waves” are only fluctuations  of 
economic variables in time. Nature of waves requires space where these waves can 
propagate. Macroeconomic models on e-space uncover existence of wave equations 
for macroeconomic variables and start studies of economic wave generation, 
propagation and interaction on e-space. Above we derive simple Demand on 
Investment - Interest Rate interaction model that admit wave equations and present 
simple wave solutions. Let show that even simple waves can cause irregular time 
fluctuations macroeconomic variables.  
 Due to definition of e-space in Section 2 coordinates of e-particles define their 
risk ratings. Let consider simplest e-space R. Let assume that risk ratings of e-
particles are reduced by minimum Xmin and maximum Xmax risk grades. For simplicity

macroeconomic density UI is presented as  
𝑈𝐼ሺ,ݐ 𝑥ሻ = 𝑈 𝐼଴+ ݍ 𝐼      (9.2) 
UI0 is constant or its derivatives are small to compare with derivatives of perturbations

ݍ𝐼ሺ,ݐ 𝑥ሻ=cosሺ݇ ∙ 𝑥 − 𝜔ݐሻ   ;  𝜔 ଵ,ଶଶ= ݇ଶܿଵ,ଶଶ   (9.3) 
As we mentioned above, integral of macroeconomic density over e-space gives 
corresponding macroeconomic variable of entire economics as function of time. So, 
integral of Demand on Investment density UI(t,x) over e-space gives macroeconomic 
Demand on Investment UI(t). For assumption (9.1) integral qI(t,x) of (9.2, 9.3) by 
coordinate x  on e-space R2 gives

frequency ω. For fixed wave speed c2
1,2 linear equations (8.1, 8.2) may have wave 
solutions with random  k and random frequency ω that satisfy (9.3). Hence random 
wave vectors k may induce random time oscillations of macroeconomic variables. 
Relations between variables like GDP, Investment, Supply and Demand etc., of entire 
economics treated as functions of time can be determined by complex interaction of 
conjugate  macroeconomic variables. Macroeconomic density perturbations waves on 
e-space may be origin of time oscillations of macroeconomic variables, origin of 
business cycles etc. 
7. Diversity of macroeconomic models and open problems 
 Macroeconomics is a very complex system and enormous number of 
economic variables and properties describe it state and evolution. That causes 
diversity and complexity of mutual dependence between macroeconomic variables. 
This paper presents simple model relations between macroeconomic Demand for 
Investment and Interest Rate. It is obvious that different macroeconomic densities can 
depend on conjugate  variables in a different from. For example, dependence of 
Demand for Investment on Interest Rate can be different from dependence of 
Production Function on Capital or dependence of Consumption on Savings and so on. 
Different pairs of self-conjugate  macroeconomic densities can have different forms of 
Q1 and Q2 factors.

macroeconomic modeling remains extremely difficult. Origin of complexity concern 
diversity of possible forms of Q1 and Q2 factors in the right hand side of 
hydrodynamic-like equations (4,5). What does that mean for macroeconomic 
hydrodynamic-like models? 
 Let propose that right hand side factors Q1 and Q2 take form of simple linear 
operators on conjugate  variables. Continuity Equations (4) have linear scalar  right 
hand side factors  Q1 that depend on density U or velocity υ of conjugate variable as: 
ͳ.  ܳ ଵ~ 𝑈 ;   ʹ. ܳ ଵ~𝜕
𝜕𝑡 𝑈  ;   ͵. ܳ ଵ~∇ ∙ 𝒗  ;   Ͷ.  ܳ ଵ~Δ 𝑈   (10.1) 
Equations of Motion (5) have linear vector  right hand side factors  Q2 that depend on 
density U or velocity υ of conjugate variable as:

Relations (10.1) describe four possible scalar linear operators on conjugate  density 
and velocity. Relations (10.2) present five vector  linear operators on conjugate  
density and velocity. These linear operators describe local  action of conjugate  
variables due to Eq.(4,5). For example Continuity Equation on macroeconomic 
density UM can have Q1 factor that is proportional to conjugate  density U or 
proportional to time derivation of density U etc. Let assume that different 
macroeconomic densities can depend upon conjugate  variables in a different manner 
and present simple possible operators. It is obvious, that any linear composition of 
these operators can be used as a model for mutual dependence between 
macroeconomic variables on e-space. Usage of each possible form of Q1 and Q2 
factors requires economical consideration and validation. Moreover, two self-
conjugate  macroeconomic variables may depend upon each other in a different 
manner. For example, variables U2 may define Q1 factor for Continuity Equation on 
variable U1 as Q1 ~ ∂U 2/∂t and variable U1 may define Q1 factor for Continuity 
Equation on variable U2 as Q1 ~ ΔU 1. That increases diversity of different models of 
two conjugate  macroeconomic variables interaction up to 200 versions. To describe 
real interaction between macroeconomic variables one should take into consideration 
action of two, tree or more conjugate  variables. To develop model equations in a 
closed form one need to consider a system of tree, four or more hydrodynamic-like 
equations like Eq.(4,5). Different macroeconomic variables may have different forms ",2017-01-20T12:36:57Z,eveoriwhat  continuity equatns equatns motrelatns relatns tse eq for continuity equat it usage ofor continuity equatcontinuity equatthat to to eq dferent

diversity of macroeconomic models incredibly huge. 
Let outline some vital distinctions between economic and physical systems on one 
hand and let mention extremely interesting and tough problems to be solved by 
methods of statistical physics to establish economic theory in a rigorous way.  
1. Economic space is defined by methods that adopt current economic 
phenomena’s. It is impossible to define risk assessment on “empty economic space” 
without economic agents. Thus economics, at least in our model, has no analogies like 
free space, point particle mechanics, “fundamental” equations, conservation laws , 
symmetries and etc. It seems that economic theory begins with description of random 
multi-agent system. That is completely different from physics foundations. It seems 
that lack of economic conservation laws leads to lack of economic equilibrium states. 
That arises a lot of problems: How to develop non-equilibrium stationary states model 
for system that consists of many interacting subsystems and each particular subsystem 
does not have it’s own equilibrium state? How to develop theory starting with kinetic-
like description? How to develop kinetic-like and hydrodynamic-like theory without 
models and equations that describe dynamics of separate e-particles?  
2. Economic agents or e-particles as we call them are completely different from 
physical particles. E-particles have size that can be determined by probability 
distribution that estimate risk ratings or coordinates of particular economic agent on 
e-space Rn. But e-particles do not collide with each other. Any number of different e-
particles can exist in the neighborhood of point x on e-space. No collisions between e-
particles mean lack of economic analogy o pressure and viscosity. As we proposed in 
Sec. 4 for local model  economic variables of e-particles depend on conjugate  
economic variables of different e-particle. Demand of e-particle do not depend 
directly on Demand of other particles, but on any other conjugate  variables as 
Income, Saving, Supply and etc. It seems reasonable that set of e-particles can 
establish some stationary non-equilibrium state determined by interaction of 
conjugate  variables. That arises problems: How to describe models for 
thermodynamic-like stationary state of multi-agents system on e-space. Such 
stationary states should be different for different set of interacting conjugate  
economic variables. How these states can interact with each other?

distribution functions without underlining equations of e- particles “mechanics” ? How 
possible kinetic-like equations on distribution functions determine right-hand side 
factors of hydrodynamic-like equations? Do equations on distribution functions 
depend on conjugate  variables?  
That is only negligible number of problems that should be solved to establish some 
rigorous scheme for economic theory on economic space.  
8. Conclusions 
 Introduction of economic space opens doors for wide usage of mathematical 
and statistical physics methods for economic modeling. Economic space employers 
risk ratings methods that were developed for decades. Risks should be treated as 
drivers of economic evolution and absence of any risks delete reasons for economic 
growth. Reasonable economic space should be determined by set of major risks that 
define current economic evolution. Economic space has different representations for 
different economic conditions under action of different major risks. It is important to 
develop procedures that can compare influence of different risks and can chose major 
risks that define economic space. That may allow compare predictions of 
macroeconomic models with observed macroeconometric data and may help establish 
econometric measurements alike to measurements in physics. We assume that it is 
impossible establish determined macroeconomic description. Random nature of risks 
growth and decline and random nature of economic space representations insert 
internal stochasticity into economic evolution and forecasts. Long-term 
macroeconomic forecasts require development of macroeconomic dynamics on 
current economic space Rn and assumptions on future m risks configuration that wil l 
define economic space Rm in projected time term. 
Modeling on economic space uncovers extreme complexity of macroeconomics even 
for simplest models in the assumptions of local  interaction between economic agents 
on economic space. This assumption allows derive hydrodynamic-like equations on 
macroeconomic variables in a closed form. Incredible diversity of relations between 
macroeconomic variables on economic space allows develop models of mutual 
dependence that reflect specific economic nature of particular problem. Economic 
space gives ground for wide usage of mathematical and statistical physics methods 
and models. Differences between nature of economics and physics are so vital that ",2017-01-20T12:36:57Z,how how do that conusns introdueconomic risks reasonable economic it that  random lo rrm moli  inedible economic dferences

physical schemes and concepts like kinetics and hydrodynamics might be useful for 
economic theory. Macroeconomic wave equations for simplest Investment-Interest 
Rate interaction model uncovers existence of wide range of wave processes in 
macroeconomics and might be useful for crises forecasting. Even simple models of 
macroeconomic waves allow describe irregular time fluctuations of variables of entire 
economics. We believe that theory of economic waves could be very important for 
economic modeling and forecasting. 
Economic theory on economic space requires appropriate econometric foundations. 
To develop reasonable model on economic space one should solve many 
methodological and econometric problems. Definition of economic space requires 
cooperative efforts of Central Banks, Rating Agencies, Economic and Finance 
Research Communities, Regulators, Statistical Bureaus, and Business etc. Many 
problems should be solved to establish appropriate econometric models on economic 
space. It is obvious that macroeconomic models can be developed on continuous 
spaces as Rn and on discreet lattice as well. Lattice macroeconomic models require 
less changes of risk rating methodologies and can be developed within current risk 
ratings definitions.

paper_eco_5.pdf,22,Econophysics Macroeconomic Model,"  This paper presents macroeconomic model that is based on parallels between
macroeconomic multi-agent systems and multi-particle systems. We use risk
ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. Aggregates
of economic or financial variables like Investment, Assets, Demand, Credits and
etc. of economic agents near point x define corresponding macroeconomic
variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Parallels
between multi-agent and multi-particle systems on economic space allow describe
transition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like
approximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic
space. Economic or financial transactions between economic agents determine
evolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic
approximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with
coordinates near same point x on economic space only and describes interaction
between macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple
model of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment
and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For
perturbations of these macroeconomic variables we derive macroeconomic wave
equations. Macroeconomic waves on economic space can propagate with exponential
growth of amplitude and cause irregular time fluctuations of macroeconomic
variables or induce economic crises.

the world in terms of GDP, have solid nuclear missile weapons and their means of 
delivery, have great political weight in the international arena in the system of 
modern int ernational relations. Rus sia and  China have established ‘strategic 
partnership relations turned into the twenty -first centu ry’, concluded an agreement 
on ‘Good-neighborliness, Friendship and C ooperation ’, and thereby created a 
strong legal basis for the devel opment of stable relations between these states.  
 
2. Main part  
 
China is becoming an increasingly powerful geopolitical player  in the 
political arena and  is taking a more active part in international politics, including in 
such organizations as APEC, SCO, the  UN, BRICS, etc. Such politics  allows  
China to realize its national  economic, political , and cultural interests.  
The Russian Federation, just like China, plays a significant role in the world. 
In fact, still a young player in the geopolitical arena of the world, Russia has been 
able to achieve considerable success in stren gthening and defending its influence in 
the world, including through the establishment of mutually beneficial Russian -
Chinese relations.  
The expansion of cooperation between Russia and China is explained not 
only by economic benefits and neighboring positi on. The two major player 
countries face common tasks, common challenges, and new opportunities are 
opening up. In our age of globalization, transparent economies and democratic 
values, they can be realized only by uniting.  
Cooperation between the developme nt of the Eurasian Economic Union and 
the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt (see Fig. 1 and Fig.2) is of great 
importance for both countries, and makes a significant contribution to the process  
of economic globalization and political multipolarit y. ",2021-07-07T09:53:50Z,rus  good friendship articial intellence  su t ft i chinese t   t icooateur economic unsk road economic belt

scientific works that represent popular views on integration processes on the 
Eurasian continent in Russia, China and the West, and which can be a 
demonstration of the geopolitical picture in the Eurasian  space.  
The first group of works is devoted to the s tudy of the Chinese concept of 
‘One Belt – One Road ’. With t he promotion of the concept of ‘One Belt – One 
Road ’ in 2013, the dedicated topic is gradually attracting great attention from 
Russian scientifi c circles. The following Russian scientists worked on the analysis 
of the foreign economic concept adopted by China: Uyanaev S. V. [1; 2], Larin A. 
G. [3; 4], Lukin A.V. [5], Luzyanin S. G. [6], Remyga V. N. [7], Kuziev N. A. [8], 
whose works consider the main goals, contents, principles a nd methods of 
implementing the ‘One Belt – One Road ’, explore the prospects and challenges for 
both the development of China and for Sino -Russian cooperation in the 
implementation of the strategy. These works helped to mak e a deep analysis of the 
characteristics of the Chinese project.  
Chinese researchers are engaged in the most intensive development of this 
issue, among which Wu Jianming [9], Huang Yipin [10], Jin Lin [11], Su Ge [12], 
Shi Yan [13], Yuan Xintao [14] can be  singled out. In their works, the researchers 
provide a detailed analysis of the political and economic aspects of the new 
Chinese strategy, demonstrate its essence and specifics. In particular, it is 
necessary to note Wu Jianmin's monograph ‘The Belt and the Road ’ and Great -
power Di plomacy with Chinese specifics ’, which evidently analyzes the 
motivation and specifics of the Chinese initiative under the changing external and 
internal environment.  
The second group includes works devoted to the study of the Eurasian 
Economic Union. Since the Eurasian Economic Union is a necessary subject that 
directly shows Russia's interests in the regional arena.  
The analysis of this group allows the author to reveal the interests of Russia 
and the possibilities of combinin g the two projects. Great attention is paid by 
Russian scientists such as Mansurov T. A. [16], Volodin V. M., Kaftulina Yu.

analyze the main provisions, the evolution of the Eura sian Economic Union, 
identify the prospects and opportunities of the EAEU on the path of the process of 
deep economic integration. It is necessary to note the works of  N. A. Vasilyeva 
and M. L. Lagutina [19; 20], whose  articles  consider the issue of the integ ration 
paradigm on the example of the Eurasian Economic Union, comprehensively 
analyze the positions regarding the project of the Eurasian Economic Union.  
The analysis of the issue of the Eurasian Economic Union is still contained 
in the works of Chinese s cientists, such as Li Ziguo [21], Zhou Mi [22], Li Xin 
[23], Liu Qingcai and Zhi Zichao [24]. In their works, the authors investigated the 
situation of the EAEU member states, analyzed significant problems, risks of the 
EAEU impact, and identified possible  solutions. Among them, it is worth noting 
the monograph by Fu Jingjun [25], where the scientist examines in detail the 
process of creating and developing the EAEU, highlights the approaches of the 
EAE U member states to the Chinese ‘Silk Road Economic Belt ’, also analyzes 
how to implement the interface of the two projects. In addition, this topic includes 
the work of Chinese scientists Li Jianming and Li Yongquan [26], where the 
prerequisites, state, difficulties and prospects of the Eurasian Economic Union  are 
revealed, as well as numerous factors affecting the possibi lity o f combining this 
and the ‘One Belt, One Road ’ project are investigated.  
Russian scientists such as Vasiliev L. E. [27], Matveev V. A. [28], Glinkina 
S. P., Turaeva M. O. and Yakovlev A. A . are engaged in the study of the 
interrelationships between China and Central Asia [29]. The works of these 
scientists assess the current state of cooperation between China and Central Asia 
and characterize China's policy in Central Asia. Among Chinese re searchers, Zhao 
Changqing [30], Yuan Shenyu and Wang Weimin [31] dealt in detail with issues 
related to China's relations with the countries of Central Asia.  
The next group includes works devoted to the study of Russia's position on 
the Chinese initiative and Sino -Russian cooperation in the process of its 
implementation. Russian researchers such as Denisov I. E.

forming a position and analyzing Russia's place on the new Si lk Road. 
Nevertheless, the problem of the Russia n assessment of the concept of ‘One Belt – 
One Road ’ occupies a significant place in the works of Chinese scientists -Wang 
Kei [36], Li Xiujiao [37], where they are devoted to considering the approaches of 
the Russian scientific community, identifying the reasons for changing the 
assessment with the international and domestic changing situation.  
When analyzing the current Sino -Russian cooperation within the fr amework 
of ‘One Belt – One Road ’, it is impossible t o ignore Wang Qi's monograph [38], 
where the author comprehensively explains strategic cooperation in the fields of 
trade and economy, science and technology, military security, culture and 
education, considering the strategy for the development of bilater al relations, at the 
same time presents a proposal. It should be noted that Chinese researchers are 
engaged in the most intensive development of this issue, among which Zhang 
Jianping and Li Jing [39], Li Jianmin [40], Jiang Zhenjun [41] can be particularl y 
distinguished. Their works touch upon the practical steps of interaction between 
China and Russia, problems and challenges in the process of cooperatio n in the 
joint creation of the ‘One Belt, One Road ’. In addition, the work of expert Zhao 
Huizhong is d evoted to the issues of Sino -Russian cooperati on within the 
framework of the ‘One Belt, One Road ’ project, where the author interprets the 
importance of Russia in the Chinese project, as well as the importance of Sino – 
Russian joint cooperation in the imp lementation of the initiative, finds out the 
difficulties facing Beijing and Moscow, and presents objective proposals for their 
resolution [42].  
3. Conclusion   
The Sino -Russian comprehensive strategic partnership meets the 
fundamental interests of the two countries and th e two peoples. The common 
interests of the two countries in a wide range of areas are an endogenous driving 
force for the sustainable development of their relations. The strategic pressure of 
the West is also an external factor in the development of Sino -Russian cooperation.

successful coordination of the two projects can effectively eliminate the serious 
discrepancy between political development and economic cooperation in Sino -

interests an d strengthen the Sino -Russian comprehensive strategic partnership.

Let Y(t) be the total output at time t of the economic system Y’ and X(t) be the total output at the same time of the 
economic system X’;  
let Y’X’,

if Y and X increase, in the long run, according to some S-shaped pattern of growth, then 
2bB12
1bbB  measures the 
relative economic growth of the economic system X’ in relation to the economic growth Y’.  
 
In fact , if both Y and X increase in the long run according to some S-shaped pattern of growth (Lewis, 1955; Jarne 
et al., 2005), one way to represent such a pattern formally is in terms of the differential equation of the well -

  growth. In similar way this allometry equation [4] can be used to describe the changes of economic systems 
undergo during economic growth. The standa rd approach  is to submit relative growth data to a logarithmic 
transformation before carrying out calculations. In fact, the logarithmic form of the equation 
1)(1BYAX  is a 
simple linear relationship,  
Y BA X log log log1 1
  
1B
 is the allometry exponent of the X relatively to the Y. 
If the relative growth of the two dimensions were  isometric  (i.e. it produces economic growth), the allometry 
exponent 
1B  should have a unit value. This hypothesis is expres sed as:  
11B
 
On the other hand, the hypothesis that X increase s at greater relative rate that Y, the hypothesis of positive 
allometric growth  or economic development , could be expressed as:  
11B
 
the hypothesis that X a negative allometric growth ( under development ) relatively to Y would be expressed as:  
 
11B  ▄ 
 
Remark : Gompertz function  
It is not necessary that the growth curves of economic system be of the logistic form. For instance, suppose that 
the pattern of economic growth is described as a Gompertz function:

  APPLICATION  
Measuring the morphological change of economic growth  
The application of the model above is based on Italy. This study uses  the variable: region’s i annualized grow  rate 
of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), m easured in Euros (value in 2003; cf., table 1A) . The source data 
are from ISTAT (Italian National Institute for Statistics) for the 1980 -2003 period, divided into 20 regions and 
three macro regions ( Table 1).  
Table 1 - Italian regions and macro regions  
Abbreviations  Macro -Region  Regions  
N Italy  North of Italy Liguria, Lombardia, Piemonte and Valle d’Aosta; Emilia -
Romagna, Friuli -Venezia Giulia, Trentino -Alto Adige, Veneto  
C Italy  Central part of Italy  Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche, Toscana, Umbria  
S Italy  South of Italy and 
Islands  Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardegna, and 
Sicilia  
 
The study here measures and analyz es the patterns of economic growth of some Italian regions (which are not 
included in the North of Italy), in relation to (rich) Northern Italy. Moreover, the paper investi gates the economic 
growth of Italian macro -regions, Centre and South of Italy, in relation to the North of Italy.  
Although differences in technology, preferences, and institutions do exist across regions, these differences are 
likely to be smaller than th ose across countries. Firms and households of different regions within a single country 
tend to have access to similar technologies and have roughly similar tastes and cultures. Furthermore, the regions 
share a common central government and therefore have similar institutional setups and legal systems. This relative 
homogeneity means that absolute convergence is more likely to occur across regions within countries than across 
countries. Another consideration is that inputs tend to be more mobile across regi ons than across countries. Legal, 
cultural, linguistic, and institutional barriers to factor movements tend to be smaller across regions within a 
country than across countries.

  The following assumptions are the basis of the model:  
1. let S 1= regional system  1; S 2= regional system 2, MR=Macro region*, I assume that S 1, S2, MR  A (country 
system), S 1MR= and S 2MR=  
2. patterns of per capita GDP grow in the short -medium run with an S-Shaped pattern (Jarne et al., 2005; see 
figure 1A).  
3. adjacent regions within a country (e.g. , Italy) are homogenous in terms of groups of people, institutions and 
firms, investment habits, savings, consumption, social status, cultures, tastes, financial positions, open -
mindedness, laws, industries, etc.  
4. the North of Italy is a ric her economic system than other Italian regions and macro -regions and it is able to 
promote economic growth in other regions.  
 
Remark : Although the North of Italy is formed by the North East and North West, which have different 
characteristics, I assume No rthern Italy to be a homogeneous system (on the whole) richer than other Italian 
regions.  
Remark: This analysis performs  comparison among homogenous elements which are sub -sets of a system; in 
other words, given the C 1 and C 2 country systems and the R 1 region such that R 1 C1, we cannot measure the 
economic growth of R 1  in relation to C 2 because R 1 C2. (i.e. , the economic growth of Italian regions cannot be 
compared with a German region because of differences in habits, institutions, laws, national system of innovation, 
etc.; therefore,  we draw a comparison “within” the country).  
 
 
The analysis is carried out on the matrix R= 24 (years) × 13 (regions : 12 regions+1 macro -region* of North 
Italy) of the Italian economic system:

Remark: Macro region * is the North of Italy, which I assume to be the engine of overall Italian economic 
growth; region i and other macro -regions are not included in the Macro region *, i.e. the North of Italy.

xt is Northern Italy’s annualized  growth rate of GDP per capita at time t, such that t{1980, …, 2003},  measured

The North of Italy is a driving force (similar to a locomotive) of the economic growth of other  Italian regions 
(wagons) and of the overall Italian economic system.  
Remark : I assume, as already said, that growth in a leading region is capable of promoting growth in other regions 
to a lower, similar, or higher extent.

The Moving Average is applied to data to smooth out the fluctuations underlying the GDP growth rate in order 
to eliminate the serial correlations. In particular , the moving averages are calculated over three years, instead of 
five years, to avoid having shorter time series for the regression analys es. These data are then transformed into 
natural logarithmic data before calculations are carried out  to have normal distribution . 
In fact, the logarithmic form of equation

 ln y t = ln a + B ln x t + t [11] 
I consider the following hypotheses:  
 if the GDP per capita growth of the region represented o n the y-axis is lower than the GDP per capita growth 
of the macro region* represented on the x-axis and B  = 1, both total outputs (regions and North of Italy) are 
growing at the same rate ( economic isometric growth of regional systems ); in this case regional economic 
growth follows steady -state growth (s*). This is similar to a balanced -growth  path. 
 
 if the GDP per capita growth of the region represented on the y-axis is lower than the GDP per capita growth 
of the macro region* represe nted on the x-axis and B  < 1, the component represented on the y axis (growth 
rate of regional GDP per capita) is growing more slowly than the component on the x axis (which represents 
the North of Italy); this hypothesis (Hp) presents a negative dispropor tionate (allometric) growth of the regions  ",2017-04-17T16:22:52Z,coameasurement new coalab worki pa no remark  north  t movi ge itse inorth   north  hp

  in relation to the Macro region * (or under development) . In other words, this generates a parti cular kind of 
unbalanced growth.  
 
 if the GDP per capita growth of the region represented on the y-axis is lower than the GDP per capita growth 
of the Macro region * represented on the x-axis and B  > 1, the y axis component is growing faster than the x 
axis component; there is a positive disproportionate (allometric) growth or economic development  of the 
regional systems i n relation to the Macro region *.  
 
Remark . The concepts of isometric, negative, and positive disproportionate (allometric) economic growth are 
based on an unconditional approach, which does not consider additional variables.  
Remark . If there are economic systems  and  (e.g. regions), with ,  A (country system:  e.g. Italy), 
represented on the y-axis, where  is a poor region and  a rich one (i.e. , with high GDP per capita), and  XA, 
an economic system richer than  and ; if X is represented on the x-axis, the patterns of economic growth of  
towards  depend on parameter B of  and  respectively.  
Remark . If there are several economic systems 1, 2,..., i,..., n  A represented on the y-axis, with different 
starting situat ions represented by GDP per capita, and  XA, a rich economic system, if X (represented on x-axis) 
is the engine of the economic growth of the overall system A, this model shows the patterns of economic growth 
of these economic systems i (i=1, …n ) in relation to each other regions and to the rich economic region  X.  
To sum up, t he cases analyzed  in this study are the Italian regions and two macro -regions over 24 -year time 
series. As the patterns of economic growth of Italian regions and macro region s in the period 1980 -2003 are S-

  The parametric estimates are presented in Tables 2A -3A (in the Appendix).4 Firstly, in a few cases the results 
from the Durbin -Watson (DW) test indicate the presence of serial correla tion in the residuals of the equations. In 
the other cases, however, the DW’s d statistic is in the zone of indeterminacy and of acceptance of the null 
hypothesis. The parametric estimates of the models are unbiased, the t-test presents significance of the  coefficients 
at 1‰ and 5%, and the R2 values are high, except for a few cases. Thus, in the majority of cases the models 
explain more than 50% of variance in the data. The results reveal  (with 5% level of significance) that eight regions 
have negative dis proportionate (allometric) economic growth; moreover, there is one suspect negative allometry 
(Campania ), two suspect isometric growth  (Lazio and Umbria) and one suspect positive allometry or economic 
development (Puglia). These results are due to a non -significant B in the regression analysis, even if the t-test 
B=1 provides for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis.  
The relative changes in the economic growth of two macro -regions in relation to the growth rate of the North 
of Italy suggest  that t here is a (suspect) isometric economic growth of the South of Italy (coefficient 0.93) and a 
negative economic allometry for the central part of Italy in relation to the North of Italy over the 1980 -2003 
period. The functions of economic growth of these tw o Italian macro -regions are:

 Economic isometric growth  (suspect) of the regional system if both growth rates of GDP per capita (regions

 Economic development of the regional system if the regional growth rate of GDP per capita is grow ing faster

The third column is the estimate of , with below it, in parentheses, its standard error. The fourth column shows 
the adjusted R2 of the regression an d, below the R2  the standard error of the regression. The fifth column displays 
the results of the Fisher test, to its right the significance. In the last column is the Durbin -Watson test, which is 
an indicator of autocorrelation of the time series.  
Note  2. N=shorter time series in some regions are due to the moving average that reduces the time series by one 
and also to the impossibility of calculating the logarithm for some values.

"," 2 1. Introduction 
 Fluctuations and waves are core properties of any complex system. Macroeconomic 
fluctuations are the most valuable processes that have impact on all characters of economic 
evolution and state. Modeling and forecasting business cycles aggregate fluctuations for 
decades remain focal point of economic studies [1-8]. Origin and drivers of aggregate 
fluctuations of economic and financial variables establish the key problems of business 
cycles. Let quote only three statements “Theories of business cycles should presumably help 
us to understand the salient characteristics of the observed pervasive and persistent non 
seasonal fluctuations of the economy ”. [3]. “Why aggregate variables undergo repeated 
fluctuations about trend, all of essentially the same character? Prior to Keynes ’ General 
Theory, the resolution of this question was regarded as one of the main outstanding 
challenges to economic research, and attempts to meet this challenge were called busine ss 
cycle theory. ” [4]. “One of the most controversial questions in macroeconomics is what 
explains business-cycle fluctuations? ” [8]. 
 Our paper presents a general model of aggregate fluctuations of economic and 
financial variables and proposes further features that describe state and evolution of business 
cycles phases. Due to [6] “The real business cycle theory is a business cycle application of 
the Arrow-Debreu model, which is the standard general equilibrium theory of market 
economies ”. Our approach to business cycles is completely different from models based on 
assumptions of general equilibrium [9], decisions making [10] and behavioral economics 
[11]. We omit review of current state of business cycles and site [1-8] for great in-depth 
discussion and numerous references. 
 We regard business cycles as essential property of economic evolution and describe 
aggregate fluctuations of economic and financial variables as necessary feature of economic 
processes. Our model of aggregate fluctuations does not require existence any external 
shocks and disturbances of economic variables. Aggregate fluctuations reflect hidden 
evolution of economic and financial variables of economic agents on economic space [12-
18]. Agent-based economic models are well known [19] but we suggest a different approach. 
Let assume that it is possible estimate risk rating for all agents of entire economics like hug e 
banks and corporations and small firms and households. Let treat agent ’s risk ratings as their 
coordinates alike to  coordinates of physical particles. Each economic agent has a lot of 
economic and financial variables as Assets and Debts, Credits and Loans, Production 
Function and Consumption and so on. Huge number of economic agents of entire economics ",2017-08-31T13:11:11Z,introdufluuatns maoeconomic moli ori toriw prr eygenl tory one our due t arrow re our   our aregate agent   eaassets s edits loans produfunconsumpthuge

"," 3 can be treated alike to  “economic gas ”. Certain parallels to kinetic theory of gases allows 
establish transition from description of economic variables of separate agents with coordinate 
x to description of economic variables defined as cumulative variables of all agents with 
coordinate x. Such transition has parallels to transfer from description of kinetic multi 
particle system to hydrodynamic approximation that neglect particle granulation and describe 
system as a continuous media. Similar considerations allow develop transition from 
description of macroeconomics as system of numerous separate economic agents with 
economic and financial variables to macroeconomic model that neglect agent ’s granularity 
and describe economic and financial variables as functions of time and coordinates on 
economic space alike to continuous media or hydrodynamic approximation in physics. Vital 
distinctions between economics and physical systems prohibit any “deep analogies ”. 
Nevertheless certain parallels between multi-agent systems on economic space and multi-
particle systems on physical space allow derive hydrodynamic-like equations that describe 
evolution of cumulative economic and financial variables. Such approach to macroeconomic 
modeling makes visible and describes a wide range of internal economic and financial waves 
that are induced by perturbations of variables on economic space [12-18]. 
 In this paper we show that our model can describe business cycle aggregate 
fluctuations of economic and financial variables. Hydrodynamic-like equations describe 
dynamics of economic and financial variables as functions of time and coordinates on 
economic space. Integrals of economic variables over space coordinates define aggregate 
economic and financial variables as functions of time only. For example integral by Assets 
A(t,x) over economic space defines aggregate Assets A(t) as function of time only: 
ܣሺݐሻ= ∫ ݀𝒙  ܣሺ,ݐ 𝒙ሻ  
Usage of hydrodynamic-like equations allow derive ordinary differential equations on 
aggregate variables and model their growth and fluctuations in time. Non-linear character of 
hydrodynamic-like equations induces chains of factors that could govern growth and 
fluctuations of aggregate economic and financial variables. Our approach reveals that 
observed aggregate fluctuations may depend not on other economic variables but on various 
hidden economic factors that define evolution of economic system on economic spa ce. For 
example we show that aggregate fluctuations of macroeconomic Assets A(t) may depend on 
factor that have meaning alike to  energy EA(t)  of Assets flow in hydrodynamics - EA(t)  is 
proportional to Assets density A(t,x) and square of velocity of Assets flow on economic 
space.  ",2017-08-31T13:11:11Z,cert articial intellence susimar vital nevertless suidro dynamic integrals for assets assets usage noour for assets assets assets assets

"," 4  Usage of economic space with coordinates that have meaning of agent ’s risk ratings 
allows describe business cycles not only as aggregate fluctuations but by additional new 
parameters. Most economic and financial variables are positive defined functions on 
economic space. Each of positive distribution can be used as probability distribution and can 
define mean risks or mean coordinates of particular economic variable. For example 
distribution of Assets A(t,x) on economic space can define Assets mean risk X(t) as 
ࢄሺݐሻܣሺݐሻ= ∫ ݀𝒙  𝒙 ܣሺ,ݐ 𝒙ሻ  
As we show below, hydrodynamic-like equations on Assets distribution A(t,x) allow derive 
equations that describe dynamics and fluctuations of ࢄሺݐሻܣሺݐሻ. In this paper for simple 
model we show that time fluctuations of aggregate Assets A(t) and action of additional 
factors define fluctuations of Assets mean risks X(t) with frequencies that can be different 
from frequencies of aggregate Assets A(t) fluctuations. We propose that economic phases or 
business cycles should be characterized my many parameters and aggregate fluctuations are 
only the simplest ones. For example Assets mean square risk ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻ 
ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻܣሺݐሻ = ∫ ݀𝒙 𝑥𝟐 ܣሺ,ݐ 𝒙ሻ 
defines second statistical moment of Assets distribution on economic space and determines 
its rate of risk uncertainty due to Assets dispersion 𝜎ଶሺ𝑥ሻ 
𝜎ଶሺ𝑥ሻ=  ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻ− ܺ𝟐ሺݐሻ 
Growth of assets dispersion indicates rise of macroeconomic Assets risk uncertainties and 
decrees of dispersion reflect clustering of macroeconomic Assets near mean Assets mean risk 
X(t). Description of mean risks, mean square risks and further statistical moments for 
different economic and financial variables can describe economic phases and business cycles 
in greater detail. Different economic and financial variables induce different values of mean 
risks, mean square risks and etc. Description of aggregate fluctuations of economic and 
financial variables requires taking into account fluctuations of other aggregate variables and 
factors that are not observed up now. For example, modeling of Assets A(t) aggregate 
fluctuations may require factor that have the appearance of Assets energy EA(t)

"," 5 parallels to physical energy exist. Such unexpected factors can induce major impact on 
business cycle aggregate fluctuations and their possible influence should be studied further. 
 Economic origin of aggregate fluctuations described by our model is very “simple ”. 
There is no need in any perturbations or external shock to derive equations and describe 
aggregate fluctuations. Economic evolution induces motions of economic agents from low 
risk affairs to high risk business and back and that motion of agent ’s risks cause 
corresponding flows and tides of economic and financial variables on economic space. Such 
tides of economic and financial variables from low to high risks areas and back govern 
growth and aggregate fluctuations of all economic and financial variables as GDP , 
Investment, Assets and so on. Enormous number of economic and financial variables and 
complexity of their mutual interactions makes that “simple ” problem extremely difficult.  
 In this paper we present simple st model that describe mutual interactions between two 
variables only - between Assets A(t,x) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t,x) on economic space. We 
derive equations that describe growth and fluctuations of aggregate Assets A(t) and aggregate 
Revenue-on-Assets B(t). We derive equations on Assets mean risks X(t) and mean square 
risks ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻ and describe their fluctuations also.  
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we argue the model setup 
and remind major issues for economic space modeling [12-14]. We argue multi agent 
systems and present reasons for usage of hydrodynamic-like equations. In Section 3 we 
discuss business cycle aggregate fluctuations in terms of economic space model. We explain 
dependence of aggregate fluctuations on description of economic distributions by 
hydrodynamic-like equations on economic space. As example we present a simple model and 
hydrodynamic-like equations that describe mutual interactions between Assets A(t,x) and 
Revenue-on-Assets B(t,x) economic variables. We show that solutions of aggregate Assets 
A(t) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t) follow exponential growth and fluctuations in time. We 
derive equations that describe Assets mean risks X(t) and Revenue-on-Assets mean risks Y(t) 
and show that they depend on factors different from those determine aggregate Assets A(t) 
and their solutions follow time fluctuations also but with different frequency. The same 
considerations can be applied to any aggregate economic and financial variables as GDP, 
Investment, Demand and etc. Conclusions are in Section 4. In Appendix A we derive system 
of ordinary differential equations that describe time fluctuations of aggregate Assets A(t) and 
aggregate Revenue-on-Assets B(t). Appendix B gives derivation of ordinary differential 
equations that describe time fluctuations of Assets mean risks X(t) and Revenue-on-Assets ",2017-08-31T13:11:11Z,sueconomic tre economic suinvestment assets enormous iassets revenue assets  assets revenue assets  assets t ise ise as assets revenue assets  assets revenue assets  assets revenue assets assets t investment mand conusns sei assets revenue assets  assets revenue assets

2.  Model Setup 
 Extreme complexity of macroeconomic and financial processes indicates that their 
description via time-series analysis of economic variables might be not sufficient for 
development of adequate models and forecasts. We propose that economic modeling should 
be based on description of economic and financial variables treated as functions of time and 
coordinates on certain space that reflect essential economic properties. Economics is so 
different from natural processes that no physical or geographical space can play such a role 
and our approach has nothing common with spacial economics [20]. We propose to use well-
known economic issues but transform them in such a way to uncover and outline their 
properties of “economic space ”. For decades macroeconomics and finance measure risks 
associated with huge banks and corporations by their risk ratings issued by international 
rating agencies [21-23] . Let make several suppositions. Let assume that current risks 
assessment methodology can be extended and generalized in order to estimate risk ratings as 
for major banks and corporations as for all agents of entire economics. Let propose that it is 
possible to estimate ratings for all risks that may affect macroeconomic and financial 
evolution. If so let use agent ’s risk ratings as their coordinates. Let call such a space that 
imbed agent ’s risk ratings as coordinates – economic space. Usage of such well known 
economic issues as risk ratings allow describe relations between economic and financial 
variables by partial differential equations and that uncovers a hidden complexity of economic 
evolution processes. This approach allows model concealed origin of business cycle 
aggregate fluctuations of economic and financial variables and describe other features that 
characterize states of economic evolution phases. Below we introduce economic space 
modeling relations according to [12-18].  
2.1. Economic Space 
 Let regard extensive (additive) macroeconomic variables as Assets, Debts, Production 
Function, Consumption and Investment, Credits and Loans and etc. All macroeconomic and 
financial variables are determined as aggregates of corresponding variables of economic 
agents. Assets of entire economics are defined by composition of agent ’s Assets. Aggregative 
Production Functions of economic agents define macroeconomic Production Function.

"," 7 by economic growth and fluctuations of corresponding variables of economic agents. To 
describe evolution of economic and financial variables one should model corresponding 
evolution of economic agents. We propose that description of macroeconomic and financial 
time-series is not sufficient to model drivers and hidden interactions that govern economic 
evolution. To develop adequate models of evolution of economic agents and their influence 
on dynamics of macroeconomic and financial variables we introduce economic space notion 
[12-18]. Our approach is completely different from general equilibrium [9], economic 
decision-making [10], behavioral economics [11], agent-based economics [19] and spatial 
economics [20]. 
 We propose that business cycles observed as time fluctuations of macroeconomic and 
financial variables are induced by a concealed dynamics and wave propagation of economic 
variables. Description of waves of economic and financial variables requires a certain space 
where economic waves can propagate. Introduction of essential economic space as ground for 
modeling agents evolution allows describe dynamics of agent ’s economic and financial 
variables alike to  description of multi particle systems. We outline vital differences between 
economic and physical systems but demonstrate that usage of similar concepts allows 
develop useful parallels between description of continuous media in physics and modeling 
business cycles, growth and fluctuations of macroeconomic and financial variables. 
 Main issue of economic space notion is simple. To describe dynamics of numerous 
economic agents we propose use agent ’s risk ratings as their coordinates on economic space. 
We don ’t study ratings of specific risks like credit, liquidity, market risks and propose regard 
ratings of any risks that can distress agents and hence macroeconomics and finance as 
coordinates of agents on economic space. Such simple proposition hides many problems. Up 
now risk ratings are provided by international rating agencies [21-23] not for all economic 
agents but for major banks and corporations only . Thus to establish our model let assume that 
generalization of risk methodologies and development of available econometric data can 
make possible assessment of risk ratings for all economic agents of macroeconomic system - 
for huge corporations and for small firms and even for households, and for any risks that may 
affect evolution of macroeconomic and finance. Below we present brief reasons for economic 
space definition due to [12-14]. 
 International rating agencies [21-23] estimate risk ratings of huge corporations and 
banks and these ratings are widespread in current economics and finance. Risk ratings take 
values of risk grades and noted as AAA, BB, C  and so on. Let treat such risk grades like AAA,

"," 8 can be extended to estimate risk ratings for all agents of entire economics. That will distribute 
all agents over points of finite discreet space determined by set of risk grades. Many risks 
impact macroeconomics. Let regard grades of single risk as points of one-dimensional space 
and simultaneous assessments of n different risks as measurements of coordinates of agents 
on n-dimensional economic space. Let propose, that risk assessments methodologies can be 
generalized in such a way that risk grades can take continuous values and define space R. 
Thus risk grades of n different risks establish Rn. 
 Modeling on economic space uncovers extreme complexity of macroeconomics and 
finance and can ’t take into account all possible risks. Description of agents of entire 
macroeconomics on economic space Rn requires choice of n major risks that cause major 
effects on economic and financial processes. To determine economic space one should 
estimate current risks and select two, three, four major risks as main factors affecting 
economic system. That establishes economic space with two or three dimensions. To select 
most valuable risks one should compare impact of different risks on economic and financial 
processes and chose few most valuable. Selection of n major risks defines initial 
representation of economic space Rn and that is a separate and very tough problem.  
 It is well known that risks can suddenly arise and then vanish. To describe evolution 
of economic system and its agents in a time term T one should forecast m main risks that can 
play major role in a particular time term. Such forecast define target state of economic space 
Rm in a time term T. To describe evolution of economics taking into account variations of 
major risks during time term T one should define transition from initial economic space Rn 
determined by n main risks to target economic space Rm determined by m main risks. Such 
transitions describe how initial set of n risks can decline its action on economic agents and 
how new m risks grow up. Transition from initial set of n main risk to target set of m risks 
describes evolution from initial economic space Rn of to the target one Rm. Such 
unpredictable changes of major risks and corresponding changes of economic space 
representation are origin of irremovable randomness of economic and financial evolution.  
Selection of main risks simplifies description and allows neglect “small risks ”. Selections of 
major risks give opportunity to validate initial and target sets of risks and to prove or 
disprove initial model assumptions. It makes possible to compare predictions of economic 
model with real data and outlines disagreements between predictions and observations.

Introduction of economic space allows describe evolution of economic agents alike to  
description of multi-particle systems. We repeat that distinctions between economics and 
physics are absolutely vital but certain parallels between them allow develop economic 
models similar to  description of multi-particle systems and hydrodynamics.  
2.2 Multi-agent system 
 Introduction of economic space allows substitute widespread partition of agents by 
economic sectors and industries with partition of agents by their coordinates on economic 
space [12-15]. Decomposition of economics by sectors allows define Assets or Profits of 
Bank sector as cumulative Assets or Profits of all agents of this particular sector. Let replace 
decomposition of economics by sectors and let allocate agents by their risk ratings x as 
coordinate s x on economic space. Such allocation allows define macroeconomic variables as 
functions of x on economic space. For example, cumulative Assets of all agents with 
coordinate x define macroeconomic Assets as function of coordinate x. Such approach allows 
describe economic and financial processes on economic space alike to  description of multi-
particle system in physics in the continuous media or hydrodynamic approximation. Indeed, 
agents risk ratings x or agents coordinates x change under the action of economic and 
financial processes. Agents move on economic space alike to  economic particles or 
“economic gas ”. Motion of agents on economic space causes change of agent ’s economic and 
financial variables. Let describe agents and their variables by probability distributions. 
Averaging of agent ’s economic and financial variables by probability distributions allow 
describe economics alike to continuous media or hydrodynamic-like approximation. In such 
approximation we neglect granularity of variables like Assets or Capital that belong to 
separate agents at point x and describe macroeconomic Assets or Capital as function of x on 
economic space alike to “Assets fluid ” or “Capital fluid ” in hydrodynamics. In some sense 
such transition has parallels to partition of Assets by sectors or industries. The “small ” 
difference: in common approach agents and their variables belong to permanent industry or 
sector. In our model agent ’s risk ratings define linear space  and agents can move  on 
economic space due to change of their risk ratings. These small distinctions allow model 
economics as a “continuous  economic media ”.

variables according to [12-18]. For brevity let further call economic agents as economic ",2017-08-31T13:11:11Z,ragent rintrodu multi introduositassets prots bank assets prots  sufor assets assets suined  mot gi iassets capital assets capital assets capital iassets t itse below for

"," 10 particles or e-particles  and economic space as e-space . Let introduce macro variables at point 
x as sum of variables of e-particles with coordinates x on e-space.  
Each e-particle has many economic and financial variables like Assets and Debts, 
Investment and Savings, Credits and Loans, Production Function and Consumption and etc. 
Let call e-particles as “independent ” if sum of extensive (additive) variables of any group of 
e-particles equals same variable of entire group. For example: sum of Assets of n e-particles 
equals Assets of entire group. Let assume that all e-particles are “independent ” and sum of 
extensive variables of any group of agents equals same variable of entire group. For example, 
aggregation of Assets of e-particles with coordinates x on e-space define Assets as function 
of time t and x. Integral of Assets A(t,x) by dx over e-space equals aggregate Assets A(t) of 
entire macroeconomics. We mention Assets as example of macroeconomic variable only and 
our considerations valid for any extensive economic or financial variable. Below we show 
that description of dynamics of economic and financial variables as functions of time t and 
coordinate x on economic space allows model business cycles, growth and fluctuations of 
macro variables of entire economics as functions of time t.   
 Coordinates of e-particles represent their risk ratings and hence they are under 
random motion on e-space. Thus sum of Assets of e-particles near point x is random also. To 
obtain regular values of macro variables like Assets at point x let average Assets at point x by 
probability distribution f. Let state that distribution f define probability to observe N(x) e-
particles with value of Assets equal a1,…a N(x). That determine density of Assets at point x on 
e-space (Eq.(2.1) below). Macro Assets as function of time t and coordinate x behave alike to  
Assets fluid - similar to  fluids in hydrodynamics. To describe motion of Assets fluid [12] let 
define velocity of such a fluid. Let mention that velocities of e-particles are not additive 
variables and their sum doesn ’t define velocity of Assets motion. To define velocities of 
Assets fluid correctly one should define “Asset ’s impulses ” pj at point x as product of Assets 
aj of particular j-e-particle and its velocity 𝝊࢐ (Eq. (2.2) below). Such “Asset ’s impulses ” pj = 
ܽ௝ 𝝊࢐ - are additive variables and sum of “Asset ’s impulses ” can be averaged by similar 
probability distribution f. Densities of Assets and densities of Assets impulses permit define 
velocities of Assets fluid (Eq.(2.3) below). Different economic and financial fluids can flow 
with different velocities. For example flow of Capital on e-space can have velocity higher 
then flow of Assets, nevertheless they are determined by motion of same e-particles. 
Macroeconomics can be modeled as interaction between numerous economic fluids and that 
makes description extremely difficult. Let present these issues in a more formal way.

variables (u1,…u l). Extensive variables are additive and admit averaging by probability 
distributions. Intensive variables, like Prices or Interest Rates, cannot be averaged directly. 
Enormous number of extensive variables like Capital and Credits, Investment and Assets, 
Profits and Savings, etc., describe each e-particle and make economic modelling very 
complex. As usual, macro variables are defined as aggregates of corresponding values of all 
e-particles of entire economics. For example, macro Investment equal aggregate Investment 
and Assets can be calculated as cumulative Assets of all e-particles. Let define macro 
variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on e-space. 
Let assume that there are N(x) e-particles at point x. Let state that velocities of e-
particles at point x equal υ=(υ 1,… υ N(x)). Each e-particle has l extensive variables (u1,…u l). 
Let assume that values of variables equal u=(u 1i,…u li), i=1,..N( x). Each extensive variable uj 
at point x defines macro variable Uj as sum of variables uji of N(x) e-particles at point x

impulse pai of Assets of e-particle i equals pai = a iυi. Thus if e-particle has l extensive

impulse Pj (1.2) of variable Uj as

random values at point x due to random motion of e-particles on e-space. Averaging of Uj

"," 13 Right hand side factor Q2 describes any action of other densities that can change left side. 
Parallels to equations of hydrodynamics are formal and extrinsic. We repeat that intrinsic, 
essential relations of economics and finance have nothing common with physical laws. 
Hydrodynamic-like equations (3.1; 3.2) describe very simple relations: left side describes to 
possible factors that can change amount of any extensive (additive) density in a unit volume: 
due to change in time and due to flux through unit surface. Right side describes any external 
factors that can change left side. Thus economic meaning of hydrodynamic-like equations 
(3.1; 3.2) is defined by right hand side factors Q1 and Q2. Due to parallels with 
hydrodynamics let call equations on densities (3.1) as Continuity Equations and equations on 
impulses (3.2) as Equations of Motion. It seems that equations (3.1; 3.2) are simple. But one 
should remember that enormous number of macroeconomic and financial variables and 
diversity of possible interactions between them makes entire problem much more complex 
then any problem of physical hydrodynamics. 
 To define factors Q1 and Q2 let outline the following. E-particles (economic agents) 
don’t collide in e-space alike to  physical particles and agent ’s variables don ’t obey any 
conservation laws alike to  conservation laws of mass, impulse, energy etc. Factors Q1 and Q2 
don’t take into account any elements alike to  viscosity, pressure and etc. Let state that factors  
Q1 and Q2 in the right hand of hydrodynamic-like equations (3.1; 3.2) on any density A(t,x)

P(t,x). Let call such variables Uj(t,x), Pj(t,x) as conjugate  to variables A(t,x) and P(t,x) if 
variables Uj(t,x), Pj(t,x) determine Q1 and Q2 factors in right hand side of hydrodynamic-like 
equations on A(t,x) and P(t,x). For example, Investment may have conjugate  variables like 
Cost of Capital or Return on Investment and their velocities. Demand may be conjugate  to 
Supply and vice versa. Let state, that conjugate  variables define right hand side of Continuity 
Equation and Motion Equations (3.1, 3.2). As we mentioned above, economic densities like 
Assets A(t,x) are determined by corresponding variables of e-particles (economic agents) 
with coordinates x. Any agent ’s variables change due to economic and financial transactions 
between agents. Thus Q1 and Q2 factors that model action of conjugate  variables should 
reflect relations defined by transactions between e-particles.  
 In this paper for simplicity we describe a local approximation  of economic and 
financial transactions between e-particles that takes into account transactions between e-
particles with same coordinates only. Such simplification [12-15, 17] allows describe factors 
Q1 and Q2 by simple linear differential operators on conjugate  densities. We use this 
assumption in the next Section.

3. Business Cycles 
 Let try respond to question: “Why aggregate variables undergo repeated fluctuations 
about trend, all of essentially the same character? ” [4].  
 We propose that [1-8] present sufficiently reasonable general considerations for 
business cycle motivations. W e simply present a model that describes business cycle 
aggregate fluctuations of economic and financial variables about growth trend. We develop 
hydrodynamic-like models that describe evolution of economic and financial densities on 
economic space determined by dynamics of cumulative risk ratings. We don ’t argue problem: 
why it happens ? We describe - what happens . Distribution of economic agents by their risk 
ratings as coordinates on economic space allows describe “repeated fluctuations about trend ”. 
Definition of economic and financial densities (2.1-2.6) as functions of time t and coordinate 
x allows define variables of the entire macroeconomics as integrals by dx over e-space. For 
example integral (4.1)  
ܣሺݐሻ=∫݀𝒙  ܣሺ,ݐ 𝒙ሻ          (4.1) 
of Assets density A(t,x) over e-space defines aggregate Assets A(t) of entire economics. Same 
relations define all aggregate economic and financial variables of entire economics as 
function of time t only. Aggregate GDP, Investment, Credits, Taxes etc., can be presented 
similar to (4.1). Thus evolution of macroeconomic variables in time is determined by hidden 
dynamics of corresponding economic and financial densities on e-space. For example, 
evolution of macroeconomi c aggregate Assets A(t) in time is determined by dynamics of 
Assets density A(t,x) on e-space. Economic growth and time fluctuations of all 
macroeconomic and financial variables are determined by evolution of densities on e-space. 
Economic densities at point ( t,x) are determined by variables of agents at the same point. 
Thus business cycles treated as “fluctuations about trend ” of macroeconomic and financial 
variables are determined by dynamics of agent ’s variables under their motion on economic 
space. 
 Usage of e-space enhances methods for economic modeling and allows indicate new 
factors that describe state and evolution of entire economics. Indeed, we use agent ’s risk 
ratings as their coordinates on e-space. For each economic or financial density like Assets 
density A(t,x) let define mean risk X(t) of particular density as

"," 15 Mean risk X(t) (4.2)  reflects distribution of Assets by risk ratings – by coordinates of e-space. 
If agents and their Assets move to more risky domain then Assets density A(t,x) shifts to 
more risky values and same happens with X(t). When agents run from risks and move to safe 
area then their Assets and Assets density A(t,x) as well shift to lower risks and that induce 
corresponding motion of mean Assets risk X(t). So, Assets mean risk X(t) follows time 
fluctuations near certain stationary state on e-space and such fluctuations describe phases of 
economic evolution. We propose that fluctuations of mean risks can describe phases of 
business cycles. Mean risk X(t) is a first statistical moment of probability distribution p(t,x)  
defined by economic or financial density. For example, Assets density A(t,x) can define 
Assets probability distribution pA(t,x):

Mean square ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻ and dispersion σ2(x) also should follow time fluctuations and can be 
useful for description business cycle phases. Growth of dispersion σ2(x) describes rise of 
economic risk uncertainty and σ2(x) reduction reflects clustering of economic agents and 
economic densities near mean risk value. Let show how hydrodynamic-like equations (3.1; 
3.2) allow describe evolution and aggregate fluctuations of macroeconomic variables and 
mean risks. To do that let define factors Q1 and Q2 for simple model of two self-conjugate  
economic densities.

propose that Revenue-on-Assets B(t,x) and its impulse in moment t depend on Assets and its

(3.1) on Assets density A(t,x) is proportional to scalar product between Revenue-on-Assets 
impulse PB(t,x) and vector x, so:

 Fluctuations of aggregate Assets A(t) depend on hidden aggregate variables XPA(t)

4. Conclusions 
 We present a general approach for modeling aggregate fluctuations for any system of 
economic and financial variables. Distributions of economic agents by their risk ratings as 
coordinates on economic space allow describe economic and financial states and processes 
by hydrodynamic-like equations. Interactions between four-five or more conjugate  economic 
or financial variables can be modeled by equations (3.1; 3.2). Such representation uncovers

"," 20 economic space induce oscillations of aggregate fluctuations with various frequencies. We 
model such tides of economic and financial variables from low risks to high risks on 
economic space and back by simple equations (5.4; B.13 ; B.17.3) that induce harmonique

Interactions between numerous economic and financial variables cause complex structure for 
fluctuating frequencies and can explain variety scales of aggregate fluctuations. Growth of 
hidden variables induces exponential growth of aggregated economic factors with increments

 We present simplest model of mutual dependence between two economic variables – 
Assets and Revenue-on-Assets to demonstrate advantages of our approach and to present 
simple derivation of equations that describe aggregate fluctuations of these variables. Even 
such simple model shows certain complexity and indicates that attempts to describe mutual 
relations between four-five and more variables will lead to modeling solutions for huge 
system of hydrodynamic-like equations and will require much more efforts and computer 
programs. The most interesting issue concerns structure of variables that define aggregate 
fluctuations of Assets. Nevertheless we model interaction between two variables - Assets and 
Revenue-on-Assets, system of hydrodynamic-like equations describe Assets density by 
Continuity equation (5.3), Assets impulses by Equation of Motion (5.4) and additional 
unexpected variable alike to Assets energy (A.6) and Revenue-on-Assets energy (A.7) that 
are described by equation (A.8). Naturally there are no substantive parallels between  energy 
of hydrodynamic flow and Assets energy (A.8). Anyway, usage of this hidden variable 
extends parallels between economics and hydrodynamics.  
 Let underline – we model interaction between Assets A(t,x) and Revenue-on-Assets 
B(t,x) on economic space and that allow derive equations on aggregate Assets A(t) and 
aggregate Revenue-on-Assets B(t). Aggregate Assets fluctuations don ’t depend on aggregate 
Revenue-on-Assets, but on variables alike to  aggregate Revenue-on-Assets energy and other 
(A.7; A.3). Thus it seems unbelievable to describe business cycles by models that take into 
account only direct dependence between time-series of aggregate variables as in equilibrium-
based models of business cycles.

requires much more then description of aggregate fluctuations.

"," 21 allow describe additional parameters of economic evolution phases that can be noted as mean 
risks, mean square risks, dispersions and etc. Indeed, most economic densities on e-space are 
positive and thus can be treated as certain probability distributions on e-space. For example 
Assets distribution of e-space (4.2-4.5) can define Assets mean risks X(t) (6) and Assets 
mean square ܺଶ̅̅̅̅ሺݐሻ (7). Each economic and financial variable can define its own mean risks 
and mean squares and these functions describe risk state and risk fluctuations of particular 
variable on economic space. Business cycles as aggregate fluctuations are accompanied by 
corresponding fluctuations of risk statistical moments of corresponding variables like mean 
risk or square risk. These parameters give additional information about uncertainty of 
economic variables and might be useful for economic and financial managing and policy-
making. Complexities of relations (Appendix B and C) that determine dynamics of risk 
statistical moments leave few chances to derive similar relations by “mainstream ” models. 
 Current econometric data don ’t have sufficient info that is required for economic 
space modeling, definition of Assets A(t,x) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t,x) distributions and 
their modeling by hydrodynamic-like equations. Thus our theoretical description of business 
cycle aggregate fluctuations can’t be verified by existing econometric data. Nevertheless we 
propose that there are no inscrutable and unsolvable problems that might prevent 
enhancement of risk ratings methodologies and development of econometric data to support 
economic modeling on risk ratings economic space. Proposed development will help better 
understand and respond economic and financial processes and improve policymaking.

Due to (5.5) economic domain on e-space [17,18] is reduced by most secure and by most 
risky e-particles (economic agents). Hence integral of divergence over e-space equals integral 
of flux through surface and that equals zero as no economic or financial fluxes exist far from 
boundaries (5.6). Thus first integral in the right hand of (A.1) equals zero. Equations on A(t) 
and B(t) take form:

 It is amazing that equations on aggregate Assets and Revenue-on-Assets require 
factors (A.6; A.7) that are alike to  Assets energy EA(t)  and Revenue-on-Assets energy EB(t) . 
These factors enhance parallels between economic modeling and hydrodynamics. It is 
obvious that Assets energy  EA(t)  has only formal resemblance with physical energy used in 
hydrodynamics but as well it underlines very important issue: adequate modeling of 
aggregate macroeconomic variables can ’t be based on usual economic variables only but 
require wide range of derivative factors like (A.3; A.6; A.7). To describe aggregate Assets

"," 23 Economic meaning of (A.8) is follows. Flows of Assets A(t,x) from low risk area to high risk 
area and back are accompanied with growth of “Assets energy ” proportional to growth of 
aggregate Assets A(t) and square of velocity ݒଶሺݐሻ. The same happens to flows of Revenue-
on-Assets energy EB(t, x). Assumptions for right side of equations (A.8) for  
𝛾௘ଶ= ܿ ௘݀௘> Ͳ        (A.9) 
mean that aggregate Assets energy EA(t)  and aggregate Revenue-on-Assets energy  EB(t)  
grow up as exponent and (A.8; A.9) give equations on aggregate energies EA(t) and EA(t) :

That allows close sequence of equations on aggregate Assets. Equations (A.2; A.5; A10) 
form a system of equations that describe aggregate Assets A(t) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t).  
Initial values of variables are defined as: 
ܣሺͲሻ=∫݀𝑥 ܣ ሺͲ, 𝒙ሻ ;    ܤ ሺͲሻ=∫݀𝑥 ܤ ሺͲ, 𝒙ሻ ;     (A.11)

A(j) for j=1,..5 are constants that are defined by (A.11-A.13) and simple solutions of 
Equations (A.2; A.5; A10) and we omit here exact derivation for brevity. Aggregate Assets 
A(t) and  Revenue-on-Assets B(t) takes form similar to (A.14) with its own constant s B(j),

Revenue-on-Assets energy with increment 𝛾௘ and oscillations of XAP(t)  and YAP(t) with 
frequency  ߱ induce fluctuations of aggregate Assets with frequency ߱ around exponential 
growth trend. Aggregate assets growth and fluctuations don ’t depend directly on conjugate

and PB(t,x) that are described by (5.4; B.5) or factors PEA  and PEB  (B.12-B.15) . Such 
fluctuations are induced my motion of e-particles from low risk to high-risk area and back on

Then Assets dispersion

Assets dispersion describes width of Assets distribution on e-space. Growth of (C.2) indicates 
increase of spreading Assets over risks on e-space. Small Assets dispersion means that most 
Assets of macroeconomics are clustered near mean Assets risks X(t). To describe Assets 
dispersion let derive equations on Assets mean squares risks. Let use (C.1) and (5.3):

Introd uction  
 
In the last few decades, economists are trying to understand the global and country -specific 
factors contributing to economic growth. The variations in market fluctuations,  financial crises, 
economic turmoil, and recessions made it hard to pr edict the economic uncertainty. An array of 
dynamic macroeconomic factors has been analyzed to determine a robust framework and 
effective model to explain the preceding performances and forecast future behavior of the 
economies. Both developed and developi ng countries face the change in macroeconomic 
dynamics and identified a complex relationship between public & private investment with 
economic growth. Public and private investments play  a substantial role in the production 
functions by providing the requi red capital for development. Public investment may create scope 
for private investment through resource creation and socio -economic infrastructure support. 
However, Public investment can  have a crowding -out effect on private investment. The IS -LM 
theory cl early states the impact of public investment on private investment. An increase in 
government spending, taxes, and domestic interest rate can lead to a parallel shift in the IS curve 
and adversely affect private investment. (Buiter, 1977; Ram, 1986). Publi c investment may also 
deprive private investment by competing in investment goods and utilizing physical and financial 
resources. Empirical studies by Aschauer (1989), Seitz (1994), and Pereira (2001) revealed that 
public investment is crowding in private investment, whereas Zou (2003) finds that public 
investment has a crowding -out effect.  
Researchers are yet to find a conclusive idea about the public and private investment 
collaboratio n and economic growth in the above circumstances. Public investments a re working 
as business stimulus policy for almost the last three decades. Public capital enhances the 
productivity of the private capital and drives the return on investment upward.

","Theoretical  and Empirical  Review  
Economic Growth Theory  
Researchers have identified two Economic growth models: The neo -classical growth model and 
the New growth model. Neo -classical growth models or exogenous growth models state that 
factors of production such as land, labor, capital accumulation, etc.,  and technological varia bles 
affect long -run productivity and economic growth (Solow, 1956). The new growth model or 
endogenous growth model argues that innovation and public -private investments in human 
capital fuel economic growth. (Romer, 1996; Lucas, 1 988; Barro, 1990; Rebelo , 1991). Apart 
from these models, researchers also used Cobb -Douglas production function (1928) to identify 
the effect of labor and capital on output. (Aschauer, 1989 ). Most of  the models confirm that 
public inv estment influences econo mic growth affecting aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply.  
Let’s  consider, there is an representative agent in the economy wants to maximize the utility with 
the foll owing function:  
V= 
  
 
In the equation δ is the discount factor  where  0< δ <1, c is the consumption , w is the work effort  
and g implies the total government expenditure. Consumption and work effort is associated with 
the utility and disutility.  It is as sumed that  government expenditure connect s with private utility 
through private consumption goods or leisure activities . The representative agent can draw the 
production function with consta nt return to scale as follows:  
 
Y=F t(L, K, G )=ALαKβGγ                                              (1) 
                                                                  
Where , L is the labor , K is private contribution in capital stock , G is government  contribution in 
capital  stock  and A is technical coefficient.   
Case 1: Lets consider α+β=1 where total output is allocate d to its labor and private capital 
factors . In this case, government contribution in capital stock  affects the other two factors. When 
the p ublic capital works as  supplement  for the private capit al stock , affect ing th e marginal  
producti vity of private capital stock through inducing private investment  and output. The 
marginal productivity of labor also faces  positive impact as both  public and private capital per 
worker increases.  Taking the derivates of labor and private capital in Equat ion (1) we g et,

Until  the margina l productivity  of labor and marginal productivity  of private  capital is equal 
there will be adjustments of labor an d capital . 
Case 1:  Now , Let’s  consider α+β+γ=1 where government investments /capital  is an inde pendent 
factor like the other two factors.  When the public  capital stock is independent  and complements 
the private capital stock and labor then an increase in public capital direct ly affects t he outpu t ",2021-05-29T03:40:26Z,toical emical review economic groh tory researcrs economic t new neo solo t ror lucas barr rebel apart cbb douglas chaser most  iconsumptit t wre case s i taki qu at unt case   wn

Emp irical Studies  
Researc hers are working to investigate the relation of public and private investment with 
economic growth for ma ny years. The studies, however, revealed different results depending on 
the sample and method used.  
Le and Suruga (2005) investigate the impact of pub lic investment and foreign direct investment 
(FDI) on economic growth using the panel data of 105 develop ed and developing countries for 
1970 -2009. The results revealed that both public investment and FDI have a positive impact on 
GDP. The results also sho wed that when the public investment exceeds the threshold of 9%, the 
effect of FDI on economic growth bec omes weaker, and the research concludes that excessive 
public investment erases the benefit from FDI. Blejer and Khan (1984) explore the crowding out 
or crowding in public investment on private investment for 24 developing countries from 1971 -
1979. They id entified that public investment in infrastructure is beneficial for private investment, 
whereas another type dry fund of private investment. Ashauer (1 989) examines whether public 
investment crow out private investment using the United States data for 1925 -1985. The results 
show that public investment increases the marginal productivity of the private capital, and higher ",2021-05-29T03:40:26Z,cet nris par bus taki private qu at unt placi isei by consiri   gt gt t emp studire sea rc t le sure ga t t ble jer khaty as haber united statt

","public spending reduces private i nvestment. The study found both the crowd -in and crowd -out 
effect of public investment. Everhart and Suml inski (2001) tried to find the partial correlation 
between public and private investment using a data panel of 63 developing countries over the 
period 1970 -2000. The studies conclude that there exists a negative correlation between public 
and private inves tment. However, the correlation seems to be positive for the countries with a 
better institutional framework.  
Deverajan et al. (1996) explore the rela tionship between public expenditure and economic 
growth using a sample of 43 developed and developing cou ntries over 1970 -1990. The study 
finds that public capital expenditure has a positive effect on the economic growth of developing 
countries, whereas th e effect is negative for developing countries. The excessive allocation of 
resources by public investment  can become unproductive and inefficient for the economy. Ghosh 
and Gregoriou (2007) also conclude similar results in developing countries' optimal fis cal policy 
framework.  
Barro (1990) examines the relationship between the growth rate of per real capita G DP and share 
of government expenditure using the extended endogenous growth model for 76 countries from 
1960 to 1985. He concluded that government cons umption is inversely related to economic 
growth, but the relationship between public investment and econo mic growth is found to be 
insignificant. Hsieh and Lai (1994) used a similar model to analyze the relationship among the 
growth rate of per capita GDP,  the ratio of private investment to GDP, and government 
expenditure for G -7 countries. The study found th at government spending has a significant 
impact on the growth rate of per capita GDP for Canada, the UK, and Japan but an insignificant 
impact for Fran ce, Germany, Italy, and the USA. However, the private investment to GDP ratio 
has a significant effect on  the USA, Japan, Canada, Germany, and the UK. Zou (2006) performs 
a study on the interaction between public and private investment and economic growth for the 
USA and Japan. He suggests that both public and private investment have a significant 
contributio n to Japanese economic growth. For the USA, the private investment seems to play a 
much more significant role than public investment.   
Ghali (1998) co nducts a study in Tunisia, in which IMF implemented a debt -stabilization 
program and identified that publ ic investment has a long -run inverse effect on economic growth. 
Ramirez and Nazmi (2003) made an empirical study for nine Latin American countries and 
concluded that both public and private investment positively impact GDP growth. Phetsavong 
and Ichihashi (2012) investigate the impact of FDI, public investment, and private domestic 
investment using a sample of 15 Asian developing countries from 1984 to 2 009. They suggest 
that private domestic investment and FDI are the two most crucial contributing factors for 
economic growth, whereas public consumption is inversely related to economic growth. The 
studies also found that public investment reduces the posi tive impact of private domestic 
investment and FDI on economic growth. Nguyen and Trinh (2018) examine d both short and 
long-term influences of public investment on private investment and economic growth. The 
authors use an autoregressive distributed lag mod el using Vietnam's macro data from 1990 -2016. 
The results indicate that public investment has a positive effect on short -term and negative 
effects in constraining long -term growth. However, private investment and FDI have positive 
effects on short -term eco nomic growth. State -owned capital stock has positive impacts on 
economic growth in both the short and lon g run.

Data and Methodology  
Data  
The study uses panel data of 39 developing countries throughout 1990 -2019 which comprises 
7020 observations. The data  has been collected from mainly two sources: Wor ld Development 
Indicator and the International Monetary Fund database. Sample data from developing countries 
across all the continents are chosen to balance the research data. Domestic private credit and 
foreign direct investment are used as a proxy of pri vate investments, whereas the gross capital 
formation, labor growth, and government consumption expenditures are considered public 
investments.

Empirical Model & Tests  
As the dataset for this study is a panel data set, to examine the research question of whether the 
public and private investments affect the economic growth, a fixed -effect or a random -effect 
model can be used to control for time -invariant un -obser vables that affect both dependent and 
key independent variables. In particular, the fixed and random -effect models incorporate an 
individual -specific time -invariant factor, αi. If it is certain that, is not correlated with all 
independent variables and is normally distributed, then the random eff ects model would be 
appropriate. However, in this case, it not certain that αi is not correlated with an independent 
variable.  The fixed -effect model is used in this study to avoid the stronger assumption required 
in this case of the random -effect model. The choice of model is also consistent with the Hausman 
(1978) specification test.

","A two -way (country and year) fixed -effect model comprised of both endogenous and exogenous 
variables is used as a first step. In the second step, Pooled Ordinary Least Squar ed (POLS) has 
been used to check the robustness of the model. The model is described below:  
 
GDP ij = αi + γt+ δ1DC ij + δ2FDI ij + δ3CAP ij + δ4LAB ij +δ5CON ij +€ij

Empirical Results  and Analysis  
Results  
As the data set is a panel, the Hausman test was conducted to identif y the fixed -effects model or 
a random -effects model. The tests examine the correlation between the unique errors and the 
regressors in the model. The null hypothesis states that there is no correlation and preferers a 
random -effects model. The estimated p -value is 00001388, so the null hypothesis has been 
rejected. It is concluded that the fixed -effect model is the preferred model for this study.  
Both fixed -effect and ordinary least square methods exhibit consistency in the results. Domestic 
private credit has a positive but insignificant effect on economic growth. Foreign direct 
investment is inversely related to economic gro wth, yet the effect is insignificant. The private 
investment variables are showing mixed results in affecting the GDP growth. The gros s capital 
formation is found to be positive and significantly related to economic growth. Another factor 
that has a statis tically significant and positive relationship with economic growth is the labor 
growth rate. In both the fixed effect and OLS model, o ne unit increase in labor growth increases 
the economic growth of the developing countries 21.2778 and 20.1560 percentage points. The 
government consumption expenditure has a negative yet significant relationship with GDP.

Analysis  
A general conception is public and private investment induces economic growth and creates 
development opportunities. However, previous researchers suggest the situation varies 
depending on various ci rcumstances of investments. Developing countries lack infrastructural 
capital stock and face weak budgetary positions but possess a strong labor force, so the 
magnitude of public investment affecting economic growth is higher than the private investment. 
In developed countries, however, private investment seems to have a higher effect due to strong 
infrastructure and higher private capital formation. Although government investment in 
infrastructure, etc., sectors are crucial, excessive public i nvestment in developing countries can 
have a crowding -out effect on the private investment. The disparity of public -private investment 
rates of return creates disparity and discourages private domestic investors.  
Public investment may influence private investment and boost the economy for the short term, 
but it may have significant adverse effects in the long term. As the government budgetary 
decisions in developing countries are inefficient and unfocused, overspen ding may require ",2021-05-29T03:40:26Z,table emical pennt variable gr rate xed ordinary least qu aria domestic private edit foredire invest me new iflows gross capital formatlabor groh rate government consumpteand it ur number adjusted snicance si table correlatmatrix analysis velopi ialthough t public as

  Developing Countries","  This paper aims to study the impact of public and private investments on the
economic growth of developing countries. The study uses the panel data of 39
developing countries covering the periods 1990-2019. The study was based on the
neoclassical growth models or exogenous growth models state in which land,
labor, capital accumulation, etc., and technology proved substantial for
economic growth. The paper finds that public investment has a strong positive

","borrowing from private sources. State -owned enterprises lack transparency and accountability, 
which hinders the plan of creating clean and sustainable development. Developing countries 
have a greater population growth rate and an increased  workforce. Still, due to poor quality 
education and inadequate investment in education, the majority of the workforce stays in 
unskilled territory. However, excessive public investment may cause the vitality of the economy 
to be lost and make private inve stment less productive in the long run. Transition to developed 
countries from developing countries requires policymakers to prioritize private investments and 
design public policies to stimulate private investment. Public investment works as a 
complementa ry service for domestic private investment and foreign direct investments. 
Developing countries follow public investment -driven economies in terms of sustainable 
economic growth and exert a strong influence over the private sector. Realizing the importance  
of private investment, China has empowered private sectors through synchronization with the 
public policies and investment to create a robust bidirectional relationship. This private -public 
investment correlation triggers economic growth and fosters econo mic development.   
The Neoclassical growth theory implies that a steady economic growth rate results from three 
driving forces: labor, capital, and technology. Capital accumulation and technological investment 
are the critical challenges faced by developin g countries. Limited resource availability can only 
be offset by technological innovation considering capital and labor productivity. The main 
instrument of economic growth varies at various stages of a country’s development. Physical 
capital accumulation and human capital development are substantial for early development 
stages but  maintaining steady growth investments in technological research and development is 
vital.  These are lacking in developing countries that fail private investments and discourag es 
foreign investments. Lack of policy, skilled human resources, and infrastructure support the 
determinants of economic growth variables that fail to generate interactive relationships.  
 
Conclusion  
The study uses panel data from 39 developing countries du ring the period 1990 -2019. The effect 
of public and private investments in determining economic growth rate has been explored in the 
study.  The results of this paper suggest some implications in con structing a theoretical model 
which structures the impact  of public -private investments on economic growth. The empirical 
results show that private investment has mixed effects  (mostly positive)  on GDP growth. 
Domestic private credit has a positive, whereas foreign direct i nvestment has a slightly negative 
impact on economic grow th. The labor force growth rate drives economic growth significantly. 
Gross capital formation is associated with higher economic growth, while the government 
consumption expenditure is inversely rela ted to the growth. Most of the countries in the study 
focus on public investment -driven growth and try to exert control over private investments. 
Focus on human capital development is substantial for economic growth, but the countries have 
less concentrati on on that sector. The evidence suggests the countries ne ed to improve the public 
sector productivity and develop an analytical framework to stimulate private investment. Policy 
support to facilitate the private investment and skilled labor force can ensur e a stable 
macroeconomic environment and sustainable econ omic growth.

","In the summer of 1977 Herakles came to John very excited about a paper
of Bob Aumann's on common knowledge. We couldn't believe the paper,
much less gure it out. Our adviser Kenneth Arrow couldn't either. Even
the title \\\\ Agreeing to Disagree "" seemed to say the opposite of the paper's
conclusion.
There is nothing more tantalizing than a paradox. As Aumann has man-
aged with other young students time and again, we were hooked. His teaching
style builds on paradoxes. He once described capitalism through a letter he
had gotten from his son about life in the Kibbutz. In the morning, the son
had written, I do something for my community and in the afternoon some-
thing for myself. Aumann said, wouldn't it be better if by doing something
for himself he was at the same time doing something for his community? He
described integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus as showing
that it is easier to solve many hard problems than a single hard problem. At
a conference in India, he was asked by a reporter to say a word explaining
Game Theory. Aumann replied that the question reminded him of Nikita
Khruschev's rst press conference in front of foreign journalists. A reporter
asked Khrushchev to say a word about the health of the Russian economy.
Khrushchev said \\\\Good."" The reporter said he didn't literally mean one
word, could Khruschev say two words about the health of the Russian econ-
omy? Khrushchev replied \\\\Not Good."" Aumann continued by saying that
in one word game theory is about \\\\Interaction."" In two words, it is about
\\\\Rational Interaction.""
A parodox is something that sounds crazy, but looked at the right way
makes sense. For Aumann, paradoxes abound. In honor of Bob Aumann, we
prove here that paradoxes are ubiquitous. We show that any conversation,
no matter how crazy the opinions and the rejoinders sound, can be explained
as the rst part of a dialogue between two perfectly rational interlocutors.
Dialogues are interactions. And they might all be rational interactions.
Turing famously suggested that one could distinguish a (nonrational) ma-
chine from a man by engaging it in conversation and then letting a panel of
judges review the transcript and vote man or machine. As is becoming clearer
today with ChatGPT, and as our theorem suggests, it may not be as easy
as Turing hoped.
Bob Aumann himself has often written that what is called irrational be-
havior by behavioral economists might one day be better understood as ra-
tional behavior in a complicated environment with constraints. Our theorem
has a similar avor. Perhaps the most comforting aspect of our theorem is

","that it provides some hope for our current troubled and polarized discourse.
Aumann (1976) dened common knowledge and proved that consensus
is a necessary condition for common knowledge, that is, that people cannot
agree to disagree about the probability of an event. A Bayesian dialogue is
a sequential exchange of beliefs about the probability of an event. It is the
prototype of a rational dialogue . One of two interlocutors states his belief,
then the other responds with her belief, perhaps informed or inuenced by
his stated belief. He then responds, perhaps with a revision of his prior
opinion (in view of her opinion), and then she responds again, and so on.
The dialogue is said to terminate at a time Tif neither agent changes his or
her mind thereafter. In Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982), we proved
that Bayesian dialogues must always terminate, and that when they do, the
agents are in agreement.1
We show here that a third party, with access only to the transcript of
a dialogue, cannot be sure that any arbitrary nite sequence of alternating
opinions is not part of a Bayesian dialogue. If the transcript were innitely
long, then it would necessarily terminate in agreement. We show that the
available nite transcript of opinions can always be continued to reach an
agreement in such a way that the whole dialogue from the beginning is ra-
tional.
Our argument covers the special case of a didactic dialogue , in which an
expert is better informed than his interlocutor. The expert never changes
his opinion, but the interlocutor follows an arbitrary path. Some of Plato's
dialogues might be considered didactic dialogues in our sense. Socrates knows
the right answer to which he leads his interlocutor. Plato perhaps understood
our theorem in the sense that in some of his dialogues he has an interlocutor
of Socrates, such as Protagoras, appear at rst to move further away from
the answer until eventually coming back to the right path.
Our theorem relies on one important premise. If an agent expresses abso-
lute certainty in her opinion, then her interlocutor must immediately agree.
Absolute certainty is tantamount to claiming a proof. If the interlocutor does
not agree, then one or the other cannot be rational. She can be 99.9999%
certain of one thing, and then 99.9999% certain of the opposite at the next
stage; as long as neither she nor he is 100% certain, then whatever her inter-
1We allowed for an arbitrary but nite state space. Bacharach (1979) looked at Bayesian
dialogues when information is normally distributed. Nielsen (1984) considers dialogues
with an uncountable number of states.

","locutor and she say can be rationalized.
Loosely speaking, one can consider common knowledge and agreement
as an equilibrium, and the dialogue that leads to common knowledge as the
adjustment path. We are arguing that along the adjustment path, anything
goes. This bears an analogy with general competitive analysis. As follows
from Debreu (1974), the Walrasian t^ atonnement that leads to equilibrium, if
it does, is arbitrary.

Irrational Dialogues?
Are there dialogues ( b1;:::;b T) that look so crazy that they could not be the
beginnings of a rational dialogue? Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis showed
that given any positive integer n;there is a Bayesian dialogue ( c;d;c;d;:::;
c;d;c;c;::: ) in which one agent obstinately maintains the opinion cwhile
the other maintains d6=c;and then, suddenly, after nsuch alternations,
consensus is reached at c:
In an unpublished paper Polemarchakis (2016) showed that any dialogue
could be rational. Di Tillio, Lehrer, and Samet (2022) extended the the-
orem to innite dialogues. The following theorem gives a similar result to
Polemarchakis (2016) but in a slightly dierent setting and with a dierent
proof.
There is one property that must hold for any rational dialogue, because
rationality presumes both agents are rational and know that both are ratio-
nal. If one of the agents is certain, then the other must immediately agree.
Certainty is tantamount to claiming a proof, and if the other does not agree,
one of the two interlocutors must not be rational.
Denition : The dialogue ( b1;:::;b T) violates certainty acquiescence if for
somet<T; b t2f0;1g;yetbt+16=bt:
Needless to say, if in the dialogue ( b1;:::;b T) nobody expresses absolute
certainty, then the dialogue does not violate certainty acquiescence. The
opinions could bounce around arbitrarily, as long as none hit 0 or 1.

Experts We described a didactic dialogue as one in which an expert leads
a student through a conversation. At a state of the world, !;individual 1
is an expert concerning the event Aif no information in the join (coarsest
renement of the partitions of the individuals) would cause him to alter his
beliefs.
Adidactic dialogue is a dialogue
(q;q2;:::; q;q2t;:::; q);0q;:::;qT1;
where the opinion at todd is unchanging, q2t+1= q;and atteven,q2t;is

 RESUMEN  
En la actualidad  la medición  económica  de las oficinas  nacionales  de estadística  no ha 
definido  o capturado  los beneficios  de la actividad  economía  digital,  debido  a la baja 
calidad  o inexistencia  de metodología s. En la actualidad  existe  un debate  relevante  sobre  
la capacidad  que tiene  la actividad  economía  digital para generar  productividad,  
crecimiento  económico  y bienestar  a través  de la innovación  y conocimiento.  Por tal razón , 
esta investigación  identific ó y estudi ó el conocimiento  especializado,  asentamiento  
humano  y actividad  económica  digital  como  los factores  que influencian  en el crecimiento  
económico  regional.  Como  resultado  se midió  el impacto  que generan  los nuevos  modelos  
de operación  de negocios  basados  en tecnología  de la información . Esta investigación  usó 
un modelo  empírico  de medición  que perm itió identificar  ciertos  fenómenos  como  los 
polos  regionales  de desarrollo  económico  regional  (PRDE)  que envuelven  a las regiones  
económicamente  florecientes.  Además , demostró  que los municipios  con altos  grados  de 
crecimiento  económico  fueron  impactados  por la actividad  económica  digital  y 
conocimiento  especializado,  hallazgo  que es cónsono  con las teorías  de crecimiento  
económico  que apuntan  a la evolución  tecnológica  como  el principal  factor  del crecimiento  
económico  moderno.  Por consiguiente,  este estud io contribuy ó con resultados  beneficiosos  
a los gobiernos  y empresas  municipales  para el desarrollo  de estrategias  enmarcadas  en 
solventar  los problemas  de cooperación  industrial  de regiones  económicamente  
florecientes  con sus vecinos,  afrontando  el proble ma de aglomeración  de recursos  y capital  
reflejados  en el asentamiento  humano  los cuales  fomentan  el desequilibrio  en el 
crecimiento  económico  y desarrollo  social.

  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has
not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the
low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant
debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate

For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,
human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence
regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business
operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore,
this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to
identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic

 CAPITULO  I 
INTRODUCCIÓN  
1.1 Antecedentes  
Desde  sus inicios  las teorías  económicas  establecieron  que el nivel  de producción  
aumenta  por la transferencia  del conocimiento  y tecnologías,  así como  la inversión  en el 
capital  humano  (Cvetanović  et al., 2015) . La automatización  de los procesos  productivos  
ha sido fundamental  en el crecimiento  económico  desde  la revolución  industrial  (Agrawal  
et al., 2019) , tomando  auge  con el desarrollo  de la convergencia  tecno -social.  
Este progreso  se debe  al establecimiento  de una nueva  forma  de interacción  
humano  – información  – máquina  (Salas,  2017) , la cual parte  de nuevas  características  
adaptativas  del ser humano  (Engen  et al., 2017) . La nueva  forma  de interacción  del ser 
humano,  así como  sus características  adaptativas  han generado  nuevas  oportunidades  en 
las empresas  dedicadas  a las tecnologías  y comunicaciones , generando  el desarrollo  de 
las economías  regionales  (Boisier,  2016;  Boschma,  2017).  
Las tecnologías  de la información  y comunicaciones  (TIC),  se han integrado  
profun damente  en los últimos  años a las infraestructuras  urbanas  existentes  (Kumar  & 
Dahiya,  2016) .  Por consiguiente,  Li & Nuccialleri  (2016)  afirman  que esta integración  se 
compone  de tres efectos  principales:  1) Mejora  la eficiencia  y la eficacia  de los servicios  
públicos . 2) Permite  la creación  de nuevos  servicios  innovadores . 3) Fomenta  la 
actualización  de los modelos  de operación  existentes  al desbloquear  el valor  económico  
de recursos  generando  el desarrollo  de nuev os modelos  de negocios  a nivel  regional

 1.2 La arquitectura  de información  y agrupamiento  espacial  regional   
Los nuevos  modelos  de negocios  que usan la tecnología  dentro  de los procesos  de 
producción  están  basados  en las arquitecturas  de la información  (Paea  & Baird,  2018) . 
Los mismos , representan  las estructuras  subyacentes  que dan forma  al significado  y al 
contenido  en el manejo  de datos  mediante  el uso de algoritmos  de inteligencia  artificial  
(IA) y modelos  de análisis  predictivos  (Espino,  2017) . Estos  son usados  actualmente  
dentro  de la inteligencia  de negocios  (Hruschka,  Campello  & Freitas,  2010) . 
Los nuevos  procesos  avanzados  de gestión  de datos  han permitido  a las empresas,  
gobierno  y organizaciones  distinguir  entre  la concentración  geográfica  y la estructura  
regional  (Forga  & Valiente,  2014) , vislumbrándose  la relevancia  de la toma  de decisiones  
basad as en el análisis  de datos  (Rahman  et al., 2018) . Por consiguiente,  la literatura  
establece  que las prácticas  de clasificación  de ciudades  mediante  el análisis  espacial  de 
datos  pueden  ser útiles  para la descentralización  urbana  y la reducción  de los problemas  
enmarcados  en la aglomeración  (Lu, Zhang,  Sun, & Li, 2018) . Esto aliviaría  la presión  
del aglomeramiento  urbano  sobre  las ciudades  más grandes  promoviendo  de tal forma  el 
desarrollo  de ciudades  pequeñas  (Manuel  et al., 2016 ). No obstante,  es importante  resaltar  
que este desarrollo  parte  de una característica  relevante  de la distribución  espacial  en la 
actividad  económica,  la cual es la tendencia  hacia  la concentración  (Manuel  et al., 2016) . 
Estas  tendencias  en la actividad  económica  responden  a varios  factores  como  el 
tecnológico,  ambiental,  social,  educativo,  económico  y espacial  (Méndez , 2016 ; Stern,  
Wares,  & Epner,  2017) . Estos  factores  influyen  en el desarrollo  de ciertas  actividades  
económicas  concentradas  en determinados  espacios  geográficos  como  por ejemplo  las ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,la los page articial intellence rd los piano to hr usc hk cappella fruits los for ga salient rahma lu  suli to manuel no manuel esta sterwarep ner to

1.3 Innovación  tecnológica  urbana  y la economía  de la información  
De acuerdo  con Kumar  & Dahiya  (2016)  los efectos  de la aglomeración  pueden  
ser subsanados  mediante  nuevas  estrategias  que vinculen  a las ciudades  con el desarrollo  
de procesos  de innovación  tecnológica.  Dado  que, como  lo afirma  Agrawal  et al. (2019)  
la revolución  de las (TIC)  ha producido  efectos  de difusión  del conocimiento,  que a su 
vez ha inducido  una importante  reasignación  sectorial.  
Esta transferencia  de conocimiento  minimiza  la dependencia  a externalidades  
tecnológicas  (Ma & Zhao,  2019) , ya que los procesos  de industrialización  y urban ización,  
en las ciudades  vinculadas  al desarrollo  de innovación  tecnológica,  poseen  ventaja  
competitiva  en comparación  con las ciudades  que no lo están.  Este hecho  permite  que las 
ciudades  se transformen  a futuro  en unidades  regionales  con desarrollo  econó mico  (Nagy  
et al., 2018a) . 
En los últimos  años las ciudades  han integrado  progresivamente  servicios  de 
tecnologías  de la información  y comunicaciones,  así como  otras  infraestructuras  y 
servicios  urbanos.  Esto ha permitido  a los gobiernos  locales,  empresas  e instituciones  
académicas  puedan  explorar  nuevos  enfoques  para el diseño  y la prestación  de servicios  
(Li & Nuccialleri,  2016) . En las ciudades  al incorporar  la innovación  tecnológica  e 
inversión  de capital  en sus infraestructuras  pernoctan  como  motores  de crecimiento  y 
desarrollo  económico  a nivel  regional  (Rahman  et al., 2018) . ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,inova ci  kumar dah iy dad aga wal esta ma hao este ny eto li nu cci all eri erahman

 Las ciudades  que incorporan  los nuevos  modelos  de negocios  mediante  el uso de 
plataformas,  así como  el de modalidades  en línea  y físico,  enfrentan  el factor  de 
proximidad  geográfica  fortalecido  con el denominado  comercio  ""Online2Offline  (O2O)""  
(Tsai  & Wang,  2015) . Como  ejemplos  se puede  observar  lo que sucede  con Airbnb  o 
Uber  quienes  buscan  encontrar  consumidores  en línea  y llevarlos  hacia  una atención  
física.  
De la misma  forma  las tiendas  conocidas  como  “Marketplace”  son otro ejemplo  
importante,  donde  los consumidores  pueden  comprar  productos  en línea  y al mismo  
tiempo  recibir  los productos  o servicios  en la tienda  física  (Roth,  2018) . Este es el caso de 
Amazon  en los Estados  Unidos  y Magazine  Luiza  en la meso  región  norte  de Minas  
Gerais  en Brasil.  Consecuentemente,  como  lo menciona  Li, Nirei,  & Yamana  (2019) ; la 
revolución  digital  ha afectado  la innovación  y el crecimiento,  así como  los grados  de 
competencia  del mercado  de productos  en relación  con el desarrollo  de estos  nuevos  
modelos  de negocio.  
Finalmente,  al ser definida  la digitalización  por Neffati  & Gouid ar (2019)  como  la 
adopción  masiva  de servicios  digitales  conectados  por parte  de consumidores,  empresas  y 
gobiernos,  y al ser considerada  como  un medio  principal  para mejorar  la productividad  
(Nagy  et al., 2018a) . La revisión  de literatura  presenta  a la actividad  económica  digital  
como  esa capacidad  necesaria  para generar  productividad,  crecimiento  económico  y 
bienestar,  mediante  la construcción  de economías  regionales  basadas  en innovación  y 
conocimiento  (Brynjolfsson,  Collis,  Diewert,  Eggers,  & Fox, 2018 ; Méndez , 2016) .

 1.4 Planteamiento  del problema  de investigación  
En las actuales  agendas  de investigación  existe  una relevante  discusión  sobre  la 
capacidad  e implicaciones  que tiene la actividad  economía  digital  en el crecimiento  
económico  regional  (Brynjolfsson  et al., 2018) . La necesidad  e importancia  de medir  al 
ser humano  con conocimiento  especializado  es fundamental,  para obtener  éxito  en la 
actividad  económica  digital  a través  de la innovación  (Mcadam  & Mcadam,  2016 ; Vega,  
Miranda,  Mera,  & Mayo,  2018) . El nuevo  conocimiento  generado  por la innovaci ón y la 
tecnología , requieren  proveedores  especializados  y mano  de obra calificada  (Grillitsch  & 
Trippl,  2018) .  
Otro problema  identificado  en la revisión  de literatura  son las escasas  
investigaciones  relacionadas  al impacto  de la actividad  económica  digital  en el 
crecimiento  económico  regional  debido  a la falta de estructuras  de medición  consistentes  
(Mcadam  & Mcada m, 2016 ; Feliu  & Rodrí guez,  2017;  Vega  et al., 2018) . Además  de la 
necesidad  de realizar  estudios  sobre  los fenómenos  socioeconómicos  asociados  al 
asentamiento  humano  regional  y los problemas  de aglomeración  de ciudades  prosperas  
las cuales  dificultan  el crecimient o económico  regional  de sus vecinos  (Li & Nuccialleri,

 CAPITULO  II 
REVISION  DE LITERATURA  
2.1 Introducción  a la economía  digital  
La dificultad  de definir  a la economía  digital  es la naturaleza  cambiante  de la 
tecnología  y su adopción  por parte  de empresas  y consumidores  como  lo mencionan  
Barefoot,  Curtis,  Jolliff,  Nicholson  & Omohundro  (2018) . La computación  en la nube,  el 
Internet  de las cosas  (IoT),  la analítica  de los grandes  datos,  el aprendizaje  de máquina  y 
la inteligencia  artificial  son un componente  dinámico  de la actividad  económi ca digital  
(Núñez , 2018) . 
De acuerdo  con Brynjolfsson,  Collis,  Diewert,  Eggers,  & Fox (2018)  los bienes  y 
servicios  nuevos  y ""gratuitos"" , así como  su proliferación  digital  son una característica  de 
la naturaleza  de la economía  digital . Esto ha permitido  el surgimiento  de nuevos  modelos  
de negocios  que incorporan  la gestión  de información  mediante  el uso de plataformas  
digitales  (Li et al., 2019) . 
Entre  las características  que distinguen  a la economía  digital  está el uso de la 
información  (Gontareva  et al., 2018)  y la manera  como  las organizaciones  se comunican  
y realizan  sus transacciones  (Sutherland  & Jarrahi,  2018) . No obstante,  los individuos  
relacionados  con el conocimiento  especializado  “científico -tecnológico” aportan  también  
de valor  sustancial  para el desarrollo  de los nuevos  modelos  de negocio  inmersos  en la 
actividad  económica  digital  (Giones  & Brem,  2018) . 
Muchos  de estos  nuevos  modelos  de negocio  comercializan  bienes  y servicios  
digitales  a costos  mínimos,  por lo tanto,  investigaciones  recientes  examinan  como  la ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,intro du cci la barefoot curtis oli ff nichols omo hand ro la internet   bryacfs socoll is die re enters fox to li entre goarea sunrland jar rai no gi onbr em muos

estos  estudios  afirman  lo expuesto  por la nueva  teoría  del crecimiento,  conocida  también  
como  la teoría  del crecimiento  ""endógeno"",  la cual busca  internalizar  a la tecnología  en 
un modelo  de cómo  funcionan  actualmente  los mercados  (Cortright,  2001) .  
2.2 La cuarta  revolución  industrial  
La industria  es conocida  como  el proceso  económico  de producción  de bienes  
materiales  altamente  automatizados  (Lasi  et al., 2014) . No obstante,  la cuarta  revolución  
industrial  ha transformado  la producción  gracias  al uso de la tecnología  en los procesos  
productivos,  la misma  incluye,  pero no se limita  a la inteligencia  artificial  y el internet  de 
las cosas  (Vasin  et al., 2018) . 
La Industria  4.0, como  se conoce  a la cuarta  revolución  industrial,  ha permitido  el 
desarrollo  de un entorno  donde  todos  los elemen tos coexisten  unidos  de una manera  
continua  y ubicua  (Zambon  et al., 2019) . Aunque  las computadoras  y automatización

capacidades  de coordinación  para la mejora  de la gestión  productiva  mediante  el uso

 De acuerdo  con Manesh,  Pellegrini  & Marzi  (2019)  la presión  de la competencia  
hacia  las organizaciones  motiva  a que las empresas  confíen  más en el conocimiento  y su 
aprovechamiento  buscando  mantener  una ventaja  competitiva  a largo  plazo  generando  de 
esta forma  una prioridad  para muchos  centros  de invest igación  universitarios  (Du et al., 
2018)  que apoyan  a los profesionales  en el desarrollo  de soluciones  apropiadas.  
2.3 La nueva  teoría  del crecimiento  
 Desde  sus inicios  esta teoría económica  incorpora  dos puntos  importantes  de 
acuerdo  con Cortright  (2001) ; en primero  lugar,  describe  al progreso  tecnológico  como  
un producto  de la actividad  económica;  en segundo  lugar,  esta teoría  sostiene que, a 
diferencia  de los objetos  físicos,  el conocimiento  y la tecnología  aportan  al crecimiento  
económico.  
 Aunque  la escuela  neocl ásica  manifiesta  que el crecimiento  en el valor  de la 
producción  a nivel  regional  es el resultado  de un aumento  en la canti dad y calidad  de 
trabajo  (Cvetanović  et al., 2015) ; para la nueva  teoría  de crecimiento  la naturaleza  del 
cambio  tecnológico  marca  la diferencia  (Cvetanović  et al., 2015) . Esto debido  a que el 
nivel  tecnológico  de producción  aumenta  a través  de las activid ades de transferencia  de 
conocimiento  e innovación  mediante  la aportación  de sistemas  educativos  innovadores  
(Giones  & Brem,  2018) . 
El crecimiento  endógeno  es el crecimiento  económico  a largo  plazo,  y a un ritmo  
determinado  por las fuerzas  internas  del sistema  económico  (Howitt,  2001) , 
principalmente  las que están  basadas  en propiciar  estímulos  para crear  conocimiento  
tecnológico.   La base de la teoría  del crecimiento  endógeno  se refleja  en la ecuación  𝑦=",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z, makpellegrini mark du la s  sort rht unique vet novi vet novi to gi onbr em el hmwith la

representa  a los factores  tecnológicos,  mientras  que 𝐾 incluye  al capital  humano  como  el

El modelo  más usado  en los análisis  teóricos  y empíricos  de crecimiento  y 
productividad  a lo largo  de muchos  años asido  la función  de Cobb -Douglas  según  Adams  
(2005) .  Debido  a que la estimación  de los parámetros  de esta función  es fundamental  
para gran parte  de los estudios  actuales,  especialmente  en ciertos  determinantes  de 
entrada  como:  el conocimiento,  las habilidades  del trabajo,  la distinción  entre  capital  
(TIC),  capital  no (TIC)  y el factor  del progreso  tecnológico  (Hanclova  et al., 2015) . 
 Para Akcigit  (2013)  las regiones  alejadas  de la frontera  de tecnología  disfrutan  de 
una ""ventaja  de atraso"",  esta desventaja  implica  que, a la larga,  una región  con una baja 
tasa de innovación  quedará  rezagada  (Paunov,  2017) . Esto debido  a que las innovaciones  
en una región,  sector  o país a menudo  se basan  en el conocimiento  creado  por 
innovaciones  en otra región,  sector  o país. 
2.4 Conocimiento  especializado  
La revisión  de literatura  actual  establece  que el conocimiento  especializado  reúne  
a individuos  que están  estrechamente  relacionados  con el conocimiento  científico  
tecnológico  los cuales  aportan  en el desarrollo  de la actividad  económica  digital  (Giones

obra calificada,  actividades  educativas  de investigación  y servicios  de apoyo  creando  así 
ventaja  competitiva  (Grillitsch  & Trippl,  2018) . 
Por consiguiente,  el impulso  que ejercen  las universidades  en el desarrollo

 Basados  en este informe , el crecimiento  previsto  está altamente  concentrado  en áreas  
urbanas  como  es el ejemplo  de América  del Norte  con el 82% de población  urbana  y 
América  del Sur con el 81% (ONU -DAES,  2019) . 
Para Chowdhury,  Bhaduri,  & McKee  (2018)  este crecimiento  requiere  de 
esfuerzos  que garantice  la existencia  del bienestar  común entre  la población , ya que las 
ciudades  han integrado  progresivamente  servicios  de tecnologías  de la información  y 
comunicaciones,  así como  otras  infraestructuras  y servicios  urbanos.  Esto ha permitido  a 
los gobiernos  locales,  empresas  e instituciones  académicas  explorar  nuevos  enfoques  en 
el diseño  y la prestación  de servicios  basados  en innovación  tecnológica  e inversión  de 
capital  (Li & Nuccialleri,  2016),  perno ctando  como  motores  de crecimiento  y desarrollo  
económico  a nivel  regional  (Rahman  et al., 2018) .  
Por consiguiente,  esta integración  fomenta  el desarrollo  de nuevos  modelos  de 
negocios  a nivel  regional  (Meijer  & Bolívar,  2016 ; Li, & Nuccialleri,  2016 ) en las 
ciudades  vinculada s al desarrollo  de innovación  tecnológica , obteniendo  de esta forma  
ventaja  competitiva  en comparación  con las ciudades  que no lo están  (Ma & Zhao,  2019) . 
Este hecho  permite  que las ciudades  se transformen  a futuro  en unidades  regionales  con 
desarrollo  económico  (Nagy  et al., 2018a) . 
No obstante,  esta transformación  trae consigo  los efectos  de la aglomeración  que 
pueden  ser subsanados  mediante  nuevas  estrategias  que vinculen  a las ciudades  con el 
desarrollo  de procesos  de innovación  tecnológica  (Kumar  & Dahiya,  2016) . Esta 
tendencia  hacia  la concentración  en la actividad  económica  responde  a varios  factores  
como  el tecnológico,  ambiental,  social,  educa tivo, económico  y espacial  (Méndez , 2016 ; ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,bas dos am norte am sur  chowdhury had uri mc kee to li nu cci all eri rahma member bli nu cci all eri ma hao este ny no kumar dah iy esta

 2.7 El Producto  interno  bruto  y el crecimiento  económico  
El análisis  de crecimiento  económico  cobró  notoriedad  en la década  de los 
cincuenta  (Gómez , 2017),  ya que su objetivo  fue explicar  el crecimiento  de la renta  per 
cápita  mediante  su relación  con otras  variables.  El método  de medir  el crecimiento  
económico  regional  es una metodología  propuesta  por Smith  en el siglo  XVIII  (Sierra,  
2015) , la cual hoy en día permite  calcular  el crecimiento  a nivel  regional,  subregional , 
departamental  y municipal.  
El ejercicio  de monitorear  el desarrollo  de la economía  microrregi onal se 
fundamenta  en la identificación  de variables  que sirvan  para generar  las estadísticas  del 
cálculo  del producto  interno  bruto  municipal  (Sierra,  2015) . En Brasil  el Instituto  
Brasileño  de Geografía  y Estadística,  conocido  como  IBGE,  en asociación  con los 
organismos  estadísticos  estatales  son los encargados  de esta labor,  este cálculo  se inició  
por primera  vez hace 24 años en 1996.  
La información  obtenida  para realizar  este cálculo  de acuerdo  con el IBGE  (2016)  
debe  satisfacer  los siguientes  requisitos  básicos:  adecuación  (datos  correlacionados),  
frecuencia  (datos  con encuestas  sistemáticas),  universalidad  (disponibilidad  de datos),  
puntualidad  (uso oportuno  y confiable)  y consistencia  (datos  confiables).   El IBGE  
(2016)  establece  que para obtener  el (PIB)  de los municipios,  se debe  ajustar  el método  
de cálculo  de los agregados  relacionados  con: a) la producción,  b) el consumo  intermedio  
y c) el valor  agregado  bruto  de cada unidad  de la federación  a la especificidad  de las 
actividades  y la disponibilidad  de información  municipal.  
Por lo tanto,  el uso del producto  interno  bruto  en estudios  microrregi onales ha 
permitido  obtener  resultados  sobre  los cambios  espacio  temporales  en el crecimiento  ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,el produ el el smith sierra el sierra ebras institute bras geo graf esta la el

METODOLOGÍA  
3.1 Diseño  metodológico  de la investigación  
El enfoque  de la presente  investigación  fue cuantitativo  transversal  ya que se 
estudió  en el transcurso  del tiempo  las variables  de interés  de una determinada  población  
utilizando  estadísticas  de análisis  espacial  multivariable  (Gómez , 2017),  así como  
ecuaciones  estructurales  con mínimos  cuadrados  parciales  (Ajamieh,  2016) . Esto se 
realizó  implementando  una matriz  de pesos  espaciales  para determinar  ciertas  relaciones  
de crecimiento  de un municipio  anverso  a su vecino.  El proceso  se llevó  a cabo  de 
manera  secuencial  y con el uso de razonamiento  deductivo  para el análisis  de la realidad  
objet iva que nos propusimos  observar.   
La estructura  de la metodología  estuvo  enmarcada  en el diseño  transeccional  de 
corte  correlacional -causal  porque  solo se midió  el nivel  de correlación  entre  las variables  
para luego  identificar  posibles  causalidades  en el fenómeno  a estudiar  (Orengo,  2008) . La 
recolección  de los datos  de panel  se realizó  en un momento  único  sobre  un conjunto  de 
unidades  transversales  seguidas  a lo largo  de nueve  años desde  el 2009  hasta  el 2018  en 
fuentes  públicas  gubernamentales  del Gobierno  de Brasil.  
Los datos  de panel  permitieron  identificar  la presencia  de diferencias  sistemáticas  
y no observadas  entre  las unidades  a correlacionarse  con factores  cuyos  efectos  deben  
medirse  (Wooldridge,  2009) . Las mismas  permitieron  generalizar  los resultados  toda vez 
que en este estudio  se propuso obtener  de dicha  población  los datos  previamente  
organizados  en tablas  diseñadas  metodoló gicamente  para tales fines  (IBGE,  2016) . ",2021-05-06T17:39:48Z,is el jamie to el la or ego la go tier no bras los woridge las

3.6.1  Datos  de panel 
El método  de datos  de panel  son herramientas  econométricas  utilizadas  para:  a) 
estimar  parámetros;  b) calcular  efectos  parciales  de interés  en modelos  no lineales;  c) 
cuantificar  enlaces  dinámicos;  y d) realizar  inferencia  válida  cuand o los datos  están  
disponibles  en secciones  transversales  repetidas  (Wooldridge,  2009) . Estos datos  surgen  
de una misma  observación  cruzada  (Sancho,  2005) , repetid as a través  del tiempo  
(Arellano,  1991) .  
3.6.2  Tipos  de datos  de panel  
 A continuación,  se describ e los tipos  de datos  de panel,  así como  la importancia  y 
relevancia  que tuvo en esta investigación  el uso de la mencionada  metodología.  
Los micro  paneles : se basa en la información  que se analiza  mediante  un número  muy 
elevado  de individuos  y pocas  observaciones  temporales  para cada uno.  
Los macro  paneles:  son aquellas  que disponen  de muchas  observaciones  temporales  
correspondientes  a pocos  individuos.   
 A continuaci ón, se presentan  las razones  para usar los datos  de panel  en esta 
investigación.  De acuerdo  con Sancho  (2005)  y Wooldridge  (2009) , los datos  de panel  
tienen  las siguientes  características:  
1. Permiten  la presencia  de diferencias  sistemáticas  y no observadas  entre  unidades  
que pueden  correlac ionarse  con factores  observados  cuyos  efectos  deben  medirse.

3.6.3  Estandarización  de los datos  
 Considerando  que las caracter ísticas  individuales  de los datos  no son las mismas,  
se utilizó  la técnica  conocida  como  escal ado estándar  (Anselin,  2003) , según  el cual a 
cada observación  se le restará  la media  de la variable  y se le dividirá  por la desviación  
típica  (Kumar  & Dahiya,  2016) . La fórmula  que se usó en la estandarización  de los datos

 3.6.4  Prueba  de normalidad  
Este estudio  utilizó  la prueba  de normalidad  de Ryan -Joiner,  la cual evaluó  la 
normalidad  calculando  la correlación  entre  los datos  y las puntuaciones  normales  de los 
datos  (Acu ña, 2009) . De acuerdo  con Salgado  (2015)  si el coeficiente  de correlación  se 
encuentra  cerca  de 1, existirá  normalidad  en los datos,  por lo tanto,  el estad ístico  de 
Ryan -Joiner  evalúa  la fuerza  de esta correlación;  si esta es menor  del valor  apropiado  
entonces  se rechaza  la hipótesis  nula de normalidad,  es importante  recalcar  que esta 
prueba  es similar  a la prueba  de normalidad  de Shapiro -Wilk.

crecimiento  y productividad  (Adams,  2005) , siendo  usados  contemporáneamente  en 
estudios  que miden  los efectos  de cambio  tecnológico  y crecimiento  económico

3.6.7.1  Indicadores  locales  de asociación  espacial  (LISA)  
El método  de asociación  espacial  llamado  LISA,  descompone  el índice  I de 
Moran  verificando  de qué manera  cada unidad  espacial  ayuda  a la formación  del valor  
general,  permitiendo  obtener  un valor  de significancia  para cada clúster  formado  por los 
valores  similares  de cada unidad  espacial  y sus vecinos  (Celemin,  2004) . Además,  
permite  relacionar  los valores  de una variable  en una localización  con los valores  de esa 
misma  u otra variable  en las localizaciones  vecinas  (Pellegrini  & Platino,  2013) . 
Estos  agrupam ientos  de especial  concentración  de valores  extremos  de una 
variable  se conocen  también  como  zonas  calientes  y frías respectivamente  (Villareal  & 
Flores,  2015 ). Según  se trate de una concentración  de valores  especialmente  altos/bajos  
de una variable,  correspondientemente.  La autocorrelación  espacial  es usada  
frecuentemente  en estudios  de propagación  epidémica,  este método  de análisis  tuvo la 
capacidad  de estudiar  la forma  en que un fenómeno  se expande  dentro  de unidades

 Para realizar  esta prueba  se usó el método  de asociación  espacial  local  LISA  
(Carro -Calvo  et al., 2017)  basada  en el estadístico  I Moran  (Anselin,  2005) . Esta prueba  
descompone  el índice  global  de autocorrelación  y verifica  en cuánto  contribuye  cada 
unidad  espacial  a la formación  del valor  general.  LISA  es un coeficiente  de correlación  
ponderado,  donde  los pesos  reflejan  la proximidad  geográfica.  En esta prueba los 
resultados  se ajustan  en valores  mayores  que 0 lo cual indica  autocorrelación  espacial  
positiva;  no obstante,  los valores  menores  que 0 indican  autocorrelación  espacial  negativa

De acuerdo  con Mart ínez & Fierro  (2018),  las variables  latentes  o factores  son 
aquellas  no observadas  directamente,  esto significa  que no pueden  medirse  en su forma,  
por lo tanto,  es importante  que existan  indicadores  para ser medidos.   Las variables  
latentes  pueden  ser independientes  “exógenas”  o dependientes  “endógenas”  (Nascimento  
& Macedo,  2016;  Bernal,  Nieto,  & Briones,  2016) .  
Las variables  latentes  exógenas  son aquellas  que no tienen  variables  que le 
antecedan,  y las variables  endógenas  tienen  variables  que le anteceden  (Taborga  &

 variables  cuantitativas  que en su naturaleza  pueden  ser medidas  directamente  (Martínez  
& Fierro,  2018).  
3.6.8.1  Modelo  de medida  con enfoque  reflexivo  
Las teorías  de medición  buscan  expli car cómo  las variables  latentes  son medidas  
mediante  un enfoque  de medición.  Por consiguiente,  el modelo  de medida  con enfoque  
reflexivo  busca  estimar  el efecto  o relación  indirecta  y total que existe  entre  una variable  
a otra (Manzano,  2017) . Por lo tanto,  si existe  un cambio  en la variable  latente  será 
reflejado  en sus indicadores  (Taborga  & Eduardo,  2013 ; Martínez  & Fierro,  2018).  
Al buscar  probar  y estimar  efectos  o relaciones  indirectas  o totales,  el modelo  de 
ecuación  estructural  va a partir de la regresión,  la cual de acuerdo  con Cazorla  (2008)  
busca  analizar  la relación  o dependencia  entre  variables  teniendo  como  interés  conocer  el 
efecto  que una variable  puede  tener  en otra. Una de las razones  importantes  para usar el 
modelo  de análisis  de mínimos  cuadrados  parciales  (PLS),  es por tratarse  de una 
metodología  de modelación  más flexible  al no exigir  supuestos  paramétricos  rigurosos,  
principalmente  en la distribución  de los datos,  lo que nos permitirá  trabajar  de una 
manera  más eficiente  con los datos  a recopilarse.  
Para concluir  con este capítulo,  la naturaleza  de los datos  de estudio  basados  en 
unidades  regionales  dinámicas  y una organización  espacial  única  compuesta  por 
microrregiones  (Ma & Zhao,  2019)  llevo  a la necesidad  del uso de herramientas  
econométricas  usadas  con datos  disponibles  en secciones  transversales  que se utilizaron  
para realizar  inferencias  válidas  dentro  de este estudio  (Wooldridge,  2009) .

  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has

 A continuación,  se presentan  el análisis  exploratorio  espacial  para el año 2009  y 2018.  
Prat & Cànoves  (2014)  establecen  la necesidad  de distinguir  la concentración  geográfica  
causada  por fenómenos  que impactan  el marco  geográfico,  como  una de las 
características  más relevantes  de la distribución  espacial.  Es importante  resaltar   que, la 
actividad  económica  no es consecuencia  de un incidente  aleatorio,  sino que responde  a 
varios  factores,  ambientales,  sociales,  económicos  y espaciales,  que influyen  a que ciertas  
actividades  económicas  que se concentran  en determinados  espacios.  
El proceso  de gestión  de datos en el análisis  de concentración  se realiza  para 
identificar  municipios  similares  según  las variables  seleccionadas,  esto se logra  mediante  
el uso de una métrica  apropiada1 y un criterio  de vinculación  que especifique  la 
disimilitud  de los conjuntos  en función  a la distancia.   
Por lo tanto,  el objetivo  principal  en este análisis  fue identificar  grupos  similares,  
teniendo  como  punto  base la matriz  de similitudes,  distancia  entre  municipios  y las 
variables  que buscamos  observar.  Esto permitió  enfocar  ciertos  fenómenos  que se

  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has
not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the
low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant
debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate

For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,
human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence
regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business

this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to
identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic
development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,
it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were
impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding
is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological

Minas  Gerais   
La autocorrelación  espacial  sirve  para analizar  la variabilidad  y el efecto  contagio  
de un fenómeno  a través  del espacio  geográfico,  buscando  identificar  patrones  
significativos  en las unidades  espaciales  (Siabato  & Guzm án, 2019) . Estos  patrones  nos 
permit ieron  identificar  el grado  de concentración  o dispersión  mediante  ubicaciones  
espaciales  significativas.  Esto significa  que una variable  estará  espacialmente  
autocorrelacionada  cuando  los valores  observados  en un municipio  dependan  de los 
valores  observado s en municipios  vecinos  (Mexiquense  et al., 2005)  permitiéndonos  
observar  un proceso  de multidireccionalidad  de las relaciones  basado  en dirección -
sentido  y complejidad  entre  el conjunto  de unidades  geográficas  de análisis.  
De acuerdo  a Siabato  & Guzm án (2019) la autocorrelación  espacial  mide  el grado  
en el que una variable  está correlacionada  con ella misma  en zonas  diferentes  dentro  del 
área de estudio,  por lo tanto,  cuando  los resultados  son positivos  significa  que los valores  
similares  ocurren  en unidad es geográficas  cercanas  favoreciendo  con su comportamiento

5.1 Conclusiones   
Este capítulo  presenta  las conclusiones , contribuciones,  implicaciones  académicas  
y prácticas,  limitaciones,  recomendaciones  y resumen  de conclusiones.  Identificándose  
nuevas  y desafiantes  líneas  de investigación  vinculadas  a las variables  de estudio,  así 
como  recomendaciones  para el desarrollo  de nuevos  proyectos  de gobernanza  regional.   
Esta investigación  identific ó y estudi ó al conocimiento  especializado,  
asentamiento  humano  y actividad  económica  digital  como  los factores  que están  
relacionados  al crecimiento  económico  regional  en 89 municipi os de la mesorregión  
norte  del Estado  de Minas  Gerais.  Este estudio  midió  al conocimiento  especializado  por 
medio  de los indicadores:  instituciones  universitarias  privadas  y públicas,  docentes  con 
grados  de doctorado,  maestría  y técnica,  así como  la aporta ción a municipios  con fondos  
federales  para la educación,  y encontró  que hubo  un impacto  significativo  alto en las

No obstante,  en dos [2] regiones  Janauba  y Januária  los hallazgos  encontraron  un 
impacto  bajo;  de igual  forma  se identificó  que la región  de Grao  Mogol  no fue impactada;  
fenómeno  que se discutirá  a profundidad  posteriormente.  Por lo tanto,  estos  hallazgos  
confirman  y validan  el argumento  de la primera  hipótesis  de este estudio  [H1], la misma

científico  tecnológico  en el desarrollo  de las empresas  de tecnología  de información  y

 Estos  hallazgos  también  son cónsonos  con Vinod  Kumar  & Dahiya  (2016) , 
quienes  establecen  que los trabajadores  urbanos  en los países  en vías de desarrollo  están  
involucrados  en empleos  vulnerables,  a menudo  llamados  informales  o basados  en rubros  
tradicionales  como  la agropecuaria.  Esto debido  a que están  en un entorno  
socioeconómico  con limitaciones  de educación  y capacitación  vocacional  formal  y 
continua , lo cual inhibe  la expansión  de las economías  urbanas.

reflejados  en el asentamiento  humano  entre  2009  y 2018  por los Municipios  de Montes  
Claros  y Pirapora,  El problema  de esta aseveración  es que en tu marco  conceptual  no se 
establece  la relación  de asentamiento  humano  con crecimiento  económico  y desarrollo  
social,  de sus municipios  contiguos  (Rahman,  Mohiuddin,  Kafy,  Sheel,  & Di, 2018) . Este 
argumento  es apoyado  por Ma & Zhao  (2019) , quienes  sugieren  que en los procesos  de 
industrialización  y urbanización  las ciudades  vinculadas  al desarrollo  de innovación  
tecnológica  como  es el caso de Montes  Claros  y Pirapora,  se convierten  en polos  
regionales  de desarrollo  económico  (Nagy,  Oláh, Erdei, Máté, & Popp  2018) .  
Esto debido  a que las características  de infraestructura  con innovación  tecnológica

y la tendencia  a concentrarse  en ubicaciones  geográficas  (Rahman  et al., 2018) . Por

crecimiento  económico  (Cvetanović,  Filipović,  Nikolić,  & Belović , 2015) . La teoría  de 
crecimiento  económico  usada  en este estudio  establece  que el nivel  de producción

paper_eco_11.pdf,146,"Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case
  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has
not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the
low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant
debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate
productivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge.
For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,
human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence
regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business
operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore,
this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to
identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic
development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,
it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were
impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding
is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological
evolution as the main factor of modern economic growth. Consequently, this
study contributed beneficial results to the local government to develop
strategies framed in solving industrial cooperation of economically flourishing
regions with their neighbors, facing the problem of agglomeration of resources

growth and social development.

paper_eco_11.pdf,153,"Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case
  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018","  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has
not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the
low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant
debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate
productivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge.
For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,
human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence
regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business
operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore,
this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to
identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic
development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,
it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were
impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding
is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological
evolution as the main factor of modern economic growth. Consequently, this
study contributed beneficial results to the local government to develop
strategies framed in solving industrial cooperation of economically flourishing
regions with their neighbors, facing the problem of agglomeration of resources
and capital reflected in human settlement promote an imbalance in economic
growth and social development.

1 Introduction
Solow introduced CES functions in Solow (1956), see also Arr ow et al. (1961), to develop a growth model
without the Harrod-Domar model assumption, which leads to m odel instability, that capital and labor are not
substitutes. Since its appearance in the seminal papers, CE S functions have become an essential economic
modeling tool. We recall some of their basic properties here to ﬁx notation. By deﬁnition, a CES function
with parameter r≤1,r/negationslash= 0assigns to a vector x= (x1,...,x n)with positive entries the number:
/parenleftBiggn/summationdisplay
i=1xr
i/parenrightBigg1
r
. (1)
Whenr >0, the CES function describes inputs that are substitutes, or perfect substitutes when r= 1.
Whenr <0, the inputs of the CES function are complements, or perfect c omplements in the limiting case
r=−∞, which is a Leontief function. If θis a weight vector, we can replace xwithθx= (θ1x1,...,θ nxn)in
Formula (1) and take the limit r→0to get a Cobb-Douglas function. We can also change Formula (1 ) by
multiplying it by a factor or raising it to a power to change ho mogeneity. The CES functional form, when
including all extra parameters and limiting cases, is the on ly function with the CES between any pair of
inputs (see Arrow et al., 1961).
Given their versatility, CES functions are the building blo cks of several models. For example, many
Computable General Equilibrium models consist of families of nested CES functions. A drawback of CES
functions, however, is solving optimization problems invo lving them. As stated in Rutherford (2002), the
usual Lagrangian calculus approach to solving such optimiz ation problems can lead to long derivations. We
claim that, by recasting CES functions as a type of norm of a ve ctor spaces, with the use of the reverse
Hölder’s inequality it is easy to solve these optimization p roblems. Similarly, the ( n-stage) Armington
functions of Armington (1969) can be viewed as the a type of no rm on a direct sum of “normed” vector
spaces. With a version of Hölder’s inequality applicable to that setting, it is still possible to get simple
solutions methods of optimization problems involving thes e functions.
2Lp-spaces and Hölder’s inequality
A norm on a vector space Vis a real valued function /ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblsatisfying: (1) /ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblis ﬁnite and convex, (2)
/ba∇dblαv/ba∇dbl=|α|/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblfor any vector vofVand scalar α, and (3) /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblis zero only at the zero vector. The convexity
assumption is usually replaced by the triangular inequalit y. If we allow /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblto be zero away from zero, then
it is called a pseudo-norm. If /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblonly satisﬁes the triangular inequality up to a constant mul tiple1, then it
is called a quasinorm. Lp-spaces, where pis a number larger than 1, are a particular rich family of normed
vector spaces that have been the subject of intense study (se e, for example, Rudin, 1991). We will denote
these spaces by Lp≥1. Their norms are deﬁned as:
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblp=/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
|f|p/parenrightbigg1

","Wherefis, roughly, a real valued function on a measurable space. Lp≥1-spaces have a wide range of
applications. For example, the state spaces in quantum mech anics are L2-spaces. If the measure is a
probability measure, then fis a random variable and /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblqis itsq-moment. To simplify our arguments, we
will restrict to Lp(Rn), the set of vectors x= (x1,...,x n)ofRnwith norm:
/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblp=/parenleftBiggn/summationdisplay
i=1|xi|p/parenrightBigg1
p
. (2)
It is clear that the deﬁnition of CES functions, Equation (1) , and the deﬁnition of the Lp-norms, Equation
(2), have the same functional form. The only diﬀerence is tha t CES functions depend on a parameter r≤1
and forLp-spaces one usually assumes that p≥1. For now on we use pfor price and use rinstead of p
forLp-spaces, even when p >1. From the viewpoint of functional analysis, the case when r <1has a
number of undesirable properties. For example, for the inﬁn ite dimensional case, the dual space of L0<r<1
is trivial2. Furthermore, /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblris not a norm but a quasinorm for 0< r <1(see Conrad, 2002) and not even
a pseudo-quasinorm3whenr <0. Nevertheless, properties of Lr≥1-spaces may have Lr≤1counterparts. For
the purposes of this note, we state the Lr<1counterpart of Hölder’s inequality. Its proof is a straight forward
adaptation of the proof of Hölder’s inequality for the Lr>1case. At its core, the following lemma rests on
simple geometrical facts. For a proof, see Hardy et al. (1952 ) and for generalizations to convolutions and
matrices of reverse Young’s inequality (from which the reve rse Hölder inequality follows) see Barthe (1998)
and Burqan et al. (2015), respectively.

it follows that for any two non-negative vectors yandx:

(This is an extension of Young’s inequality, see Rudin (1991 )). To check this, consider the function y=xr−1
and its inverse x=ys−1. Both functions are decreasing since r,s <1. By evaluating the right hand side of
the equation below, it is easy to show that:

Eithera≥bs−1ora≤bs−1in the domain of the ﬁrst integral of the above equation. If we assume
the former case, then the right-hand side of Equation (4) cal culates the area of shaded region of Figure 1.
Since this region is contained in a rectangle with area equal toab, the statement follows. We can give an
algebraic proof of the statement by starting with a≥x≥bs−1, and raising these numbers by r−1to get
b≥xr−1≥ar−1. Setting y=xr−1, we can raise the last inequality by s−1to geta≥ys−1≥bs−1. Hence,
/integraldisplaya

2Namely, under these assumptions, if φis a continuous linear function on Lrthenφ= 0. For a proof, see Conrad (2002).
In particular, if x: [0,1]→Ris a continuum of goods with prices p: [0,1]→Rthen the linear functional p(x) =/integraltextpxis not
continuous with respect to a utility function deﬁned by /bardbl · /bardblr. For example, if we set prices to be equal to 1for every good
and consider the sequence of consumption bundles xn=nχ[0,1
n], whereχis an indicator function, then /bardblxn/bardblr=nr−1→0as
n→ ∞, (xnapproaches the zero bundle as nincreases) but p(xn) = 1 for allnwhereas p(0) = 0 .
3Whenr <0, it is natural to assume that /bardblx/bardblr= 0whenever xhas a zero entry. We can write any vector vofLr<0(Rn)as a
sum of two vectors v1,v2each of which with a zero entry. If /bardbl·/bardblrwas a pseudo-quasinorm, then /bardblv/bardblr≤K(/bardblv1/bardblr+/bardblv2/bardblr) = 0
for any vector v, a contradiction.

To cover the Armington case, we need to consider a version of H ölder’s inequality for the direct sum of
Lr≤1-spaces. When r≥1, there is no obvious best candidate for a norm on a direct sum o fLr-spaces.
Banach considered the following norms for such spaces in Ban ach (2009). Let Lr1(Rn1),...,Lrm(Rnm)be
spaces with ri≥1,i= 1,...,m . We can use the given norms to deﬁne a function on their direct sum:
N:Rn1×···×Rnm−→Rm,
(x1,...,x m)/mapsto→(/ba∇dblx1/ba∇dblr1,...,/ba∇dblxm/ba∇dblrm).
We can endow Rm, the target space of N, with an Lrnorm, for any r≥1. Composing the function Nwith
any such norm deﬁnes a new function on the direct sum. The new f unction is still a norm and the space is
still a Banach space.
If in the previous construction we assume instead that ri≤1for all cases i, then the constructed “norm”
is an Armington function (usually the norm picked over Rmis theL0one). A version of Hölder’s inequality
also exists on this setting.

","Example 1 (CES Utility Function) .Letx= (x1,...,x n)be a bundle of goods (a vector in Rnwith positive
entries), and Uan utility function over such bundles. Assuming that Uis a CES function then, from the
previous section, we think of the bundle xas a point in a Lr(Rn)-space for some r≤1,r/negationslash= 0. Similarly,
from the perspective of the previous section, it is natural t o consider a price vector p(a vector of positive
entries in Rn) of the bundle xas a point in Ls(Rn)where
1
r+1
s= 1.
(In other words, a “ r-norm”/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblron the space of goods induces a “ s-norm”/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblson the space of prices.) Let
us start with the problem of minimizing expenditure given ut ility and price levels. Suppose that U(x) =u,
from Lemma 1 (reverse Hölder’s inequality), we always have t hat:
x·p=n/summationdisplay
i=1pixi≥ /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblr/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbls=u/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbls.
Since the above inequality is true for any bundle with utilit y levelu, we get a lower bound to the expenditure
function: e(u,p)≥u/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbls. To show that this lower bound is sharp, we show that there is a feasible consump-
tion bundle x(a vector with positive entries) satisfying the lower bound . If we had that e(u,p) =u/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbls,
then, since the utility function is locally nonsatiated and strictly convex, the Hicksian demand function
equals to:
x(u,p) =∇pe(u,p) =u/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblσ
sp−σ.
Whereσ= 1−s=1
1−randp−σ= (p−σ
1,...,p−σ
n). Since all terms on the left-hand side of the above equation
are positive, x(u,p)is a feasible bundle and the lower bound under consideration is sharp. Furthermore,
since the lower bound is sharp, we can view /ba∇dblp/ba∇dblsas the cost of a unit of utility for a given price p, and hence
the price index4is:
PK(p1,p0,u) =e(u,p1)
e(u,p0)=/ba∇dblp1/ba∇dbls
/ba∇dblp0/ba∇dbls.
We now consider the dual problem of maximizing utility given price and wealth constraints. This can be
solved by noting that if the expenditure function is e(u,p) =u/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblsthen the indirect utility function is equal
to:
ν(m,p) =m/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbl−1
s.
By Roy’s identity, the Marshallian demand function equals t o:
x(m,p) =−∇pν(p,m)
∇mν(p,m)=m/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblσ

Remark 2. The above example avoided solving expenditure minimizatio n problems via Lagrange multiplier
methods by getting a lower bound to the expenditure function using ideas from functional analysis and
showing that the bound is sharp. Related utility maximizati on problems were then solved by using results
that are applicable to general settings.
Remark 3 (CES with weights and Cobb-Douglas) .We can adapt Example 1 to the CES with weights or
the Cobb-Douglas case by starting from the inequalities (se e Corollary 1):

r−1let:/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl=/ba∇dblX/ba∇dblr, and/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbl•=/ba∇dblP/ba∇dbls. These are Armington functions.
By Corollary 2, we have x·p≥ /ba∇dblX/ba∇dblr/ba∇dblP/ba∇dbls. Hence, e(u,p)≥u/ba∇dblP/ba∇dbls. By the chain rule, ∇pu/ba∇dblP/ba∇dblsis a product
of positive numbers, hence the lower bound is sharp. In parti cular, the Hicksian demand functions are:

Whereσ= 1−s, andσi= 1−siare the elasticities. As in Example 1, /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl•is the cost of a unit of utility

Since the indirect utility function is ν(m,p) =m/ba∇dblP/ba∇dbl−1

are:

As in Example 1, we can interpret the fractions of the last for mula in terms of shares of allocated budget.
Remark 4. As in Remark 3, we can introduce weights θto the previous Armington function example and
take the limit r→0to an Armington utility function where the aggregate functi on is a Cobb-Douglas
function. In this case, we have: e(u,p) =u/producttext/parenleftbig
θi−1/ba∇dblpi/ba∇dblsi/parenrightbigθi=u/ba∇dblθ−1P/ba∇dbl0,θ.The price index is then:

The indirect utility function is ν(m,p) =m/ba∇dblP/ba∇dbl−1

xi(m,p) =mθi

As before, we can interpret the last formula in terms of budge t shares.
Remark 5 (Armington with several stages) .We can introduce more stages to the Armington function by
aggregating ﬁnite sets of Armington functions using Cobb-D ouglas or CES functions. These process can be
repeated ntimes. Hölder’s inequality, as stated in Corollary 2, can be extended to these cases by induction.
Example 2 can be adapted to these cases. In particular, the Ma rshallian demand function is again a product
of factors that can be understood as budget shares.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we consider CES, Cobb-Douglas and Armington f unctions as Lr≤1(Rn)-spaces, or direct sums of
these spaces. We use a central result of Lr≥1-spaces, reverse Hölder’s inequality, to obtain simple der ivations
of main economic formulas such as Hicksian and Marshallian d emand functions. Going in the other direction,
economic theory suggests a new family of L0-spaces. To aid intuition, see Table 1 for a dictionary of gui ding
concepts and Figure 2 for a depiction of sample solution sets /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblr= 1, for−∞ ≤r≤ ∞.

 1. Introduction 
Individuals gather information on economic conditions from several different sources. Some of the 
main sources are various media outlet s, such as newspapers, magazines and online publications 
(Fogarty 2005).  The media  often reports  on current factual events  and, to some extent,  re-report s news 
that is published by  expert s in public reports and scientific papers  (Nadeu et al. 1999) . However, t he 
media  is not entirely neutral  and can sometimes put a filter  on reality when  newspapers  select and  
frame news stories to capture individuals’ attention  (Gentzkow & Shapiro 2008;  McCarthy & Dolfsma 
2014) . Individuals using the media  to inform themselves about economic conditions  may thus become 
biased  in their opinions and expectations  about the future,  causing them to make wrong  decisions  (van 
Raaij 1989) . 
 
Public  opinion about economic  conditions is paramount to economic outcomes. Individuals’ 
expectations about the state of the economy influence their decisions in terms of savings , 
consumption, investments  and entrepreneurial endeavours (e.g. Keynes  1936; Lachmann 1943; Muth 
1961, Arenius & Minniti  2005; Koellinger et al . 2007;  Brown & Taylor  2006;  Moretti 2011;  
Hirshleife r 2001; Baker &  Wurgler  2007; Burnside et al. 2011). Because the media has an  incentive to 
put a filter on economic conditions,  they may have a de -stabilizing effect on the economy . For 
example, since t he media tries to capture individuals’ attention by over -emphasizing the negative 
aspects of economic conditions, they may cause individuals  to overestimate the risk of the economy 
entering  into a recession . As a consequence of this i ndividuals may decide to postpone consumption,  
investment  and entrepreneurial endeavo urs more than what is motivated by actual economic 
conditions . This could potentially be the decisive factor that causes the economy to go into a recession  
(Pigou 1927; Jaimovich &  Rebelo 2009) . 
 In this paper, we test if the way Swedish  media report  on economic conditions affects individuals’ 
opinions and expectations  about them . We do this by testing if individuals’ opinions and expectations 
about economic conditions are Granger -caused by economi c media sentiment  when  controlling for ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,introduindividuals some fog party t nad eu gent  shapi mc party dfs individuals ra articial intellence public individuals eyeamanmath are ni init  el lier broaylor i harsh leaf baker wu rgl er burnsi because for as  pot imo rirebel i

learning method  for text classification of media items’  sentiment based on their  full textual content . 
We use 179,846 media i tems , stemming from 1,071 unique media outlets including the major 
nationwide newspapers, local newspapers and online news during  the 1993 –2017 period, to observe 
the development of sentiment in the Swedish economic media . We are thus including  several booms 
and busts in the real economy and in the financial markets. The data that we use gives us unique 
possibilities compared to other studies that typically are limited to a few time periods or a few media 
outlets . 
 
Our results show that the economic media sentiment is slightly positive on average. Individuals’ 
opinion  about  current macroeconomic conditions is Granger -caused by economic media sentiment and 
affected by macroeconomic variables . However, e conomic media sentiment does not Granger -cause 
individuals’ expectations about future macroeconomic conditions, individuals’ expectations about 
their own personal economic situation or individuals’ evaluation of current developments concerning 
their own private economic situation.

effects  of competition among media companies  on economic media sentiment  and the effect of

 2. The News Media and Competition : Three  Hypothes es 
Information published by the media is an important component of an individuals’ information set. 
Individuals are constrained  in their attention and  thus often use the media to  form an opinion about  
matters that require high cognitive effort , such as  predicting  economic outcomes . Information 
presented by the  media is easier  for individuals  to access and process  than,  for example , economic and 
meteorological data published  in tables or reports by national statistics agencies  and central banks . 
Individuals  who consum e information published in the media  thus only need to use relatively little 
cognitive effort to form an opinion about  complex matters , which allows  them  to allocate their 
attention  efficiently . The way the media reports economic conditions  may thus affect  individuals’ 
information set and thereby  the decisions they make  (e.g. Carroll 2003, Sims 2001) . 
 
In most economies , different  media outlets compete in a market for news  (Winseck 2008) . 
Competition for market shares  between different media outlets should theoretically cause  the media  to 
report on events that are of great importance to most individuals (Mullainathan & Schleifer 2005) . 
Media  that are  successful  in doing so in a fast, accurate and neutral manner  will also be successful in  
selling their product  and in generating  returns to their shareholders . If the  media  reports relevant 
information,  this will enable individuals  to be well informed about current and important matters , 
which will allow them to make  adequate  decisions (Gentzkow & Shapiro 2008) . 
 Competition for market shares between different media outlets may, however, cause the media to  not 
report objectively on economic conditions . The reason for this is that when media companies  compete 
for market shares they are de facto  competing for  consumers’ attention . This  may cause the media  to 
exaggerate the importance of some events and underemphasize  the importance of other s. The daily 
press , for example, may potentially  maximize its revenue by  selecting  their main stor ies based on how 
well the essence of the story can be translated into an eye -catching headline . Such a headline  has a 
greater potential of capturing  individuals’ attention , causing them to buy single copies  of the 
newspaper  (Tannenbaum 1953) . The media may thus not report on economic conditions to the extent ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,t news media etitthree typo t informatindividuals informatindividuals t carroll sims iwisec etitfull ithasleaf er media  gent  shapi etitt  t sutannenbaum t

develop a measure of economic media sentiment using a supervised machine

1,071 unique media outlets, and use the number of news items with positive and
negative sentiment to construct a time series index of economic media

aggregate perception of macroeconomic reality.

 that is actually motivated  by economic  data, but instead report more on  other topics  which the media  
regard as better headline material  (Andrew 2007) . Another  possible  consequence of media competition 
is that the media may over -report and exaggerate the consequences of negative aspects of  economic 
conditions . This implies  that the media , albeit reporting on relevant and important economic events,  
tend to exaggerate the sensational and eye -catching aspects of economic events such as economic 
crisis and stock market crashes  in order to attract individuals’ attention (Hester &  Gibson 2003) . 
Newspapers may also capture the attention of customers by tailoring their reporting to fit the political-
ideological conviction of their target market segment. Newspapers thus over -emphasize some topics, 
such as unemployment, if the opposing political party is in power (Larcinese et al. 2011).  
 
There is some evidence in the literature showing that the media  sentiment is not neutral . The media 
generally report s on current  events and we thus expect economic media to mainly report on current  
business cycle conditions  rather than long- term economic developments , such as economic growth . A 
neutral  economic  media should thus publish equally many  media items with positive and negative 
sentiment, in the long run. Most previous studies , however,  find that the media tends to publish  more 
content with negative sentiment than pos itive sentiment , which may be a consequence of the 
competition between media outlets (Fogarty 2005; Arango -Kure et al. 2014; Boydstun et al . 2018) . 
This literature , however,  mainly  uses US  data and few studies have investigated whether media in 
other economies behave in a similar way.  Media  non-neutrality  is likely to  exist also in Sweden where 
the media , for example, reported heavily on the negative consequences of the global financial crisis of 
2008,  despite the fact that economic data showed that the Swedish economy was less affected by the 
crisis than many other economies ( Claessens et al. 2010; Olsson et al . 2015) . This brings us to our first  
hypothesis:  
 
H1: Economic media is not neutral  and therefore publishes  unequally many items with positive 
and negative sentiment .

 Since i ndividuals use  the media to inform themselves about economic conditions , they  may become 
biased in their opinions and expectations about economic conditions (van Raaij 1989). There is , 
however,  no consensus in the  literature concerning the effect of economic media on individuals’  
evaluations and expectations  about economic conditions . Some studies find little or no effect of the 
media  on individuals’ opinions about current and future economic conditions  (Fogarty 2005). Others 
find that the economic media  affects individuals’ opinions about both the current state of the macro 
economy and their expectations about the future developments of  macroeconomic  conditions (Hester 
& Gibson 2003) . There is also some evi dence that  media  sentiment  that cannot be explained by 
economic data  affects individuals’  opinions and expectations about economic conditions . This 
suggests that media non -neutrality  may influence individuals’ perceptions of economic reality 
(Boydstun et al. 2018).  This brings us to our second  hypothesis:  
 
H2: Individuals’ opinions and expectations about current and future economic conditions are 
Granger- caused by economic media  content  that is not explained  by economic data.  
 
Individuals are sometimes better informed than the media  about changes in economic conditions . The 
economic media  typically reports on changes in macroeconomic conditions that affect  most 
individuals  in the economy . Individuals may, however, have access to better  sources of information 
about their own personal economic situation that the media  cannot access  (Wåhlberg & Sjöberg 2000) . 
This information is likely to be private and more directly linked to individuals’  own economic

macro economic events  when they asses s their own personal economic situation  (Bovi 2011) . This 
brings us to  our third and final  hypothesis:   
 
H3: Economic media  content does not Granger -cause  individuals’ opinions and expectations 
about their private economic situation.  
 
3. Economic Media Data 
In order to test  our hypothes es, we need to quantify economic media content . Some studies do this by 
using  economic data as proxies for economic  media  content  (Alwathainani 2010;  Nguyen & Claus 
2013). This approach is problematic  since it is not a direct measure of media content . It thus assume s 
both that individuals use the media to inform themselves about economic conditions and that the 
media report s neutrally on these conditions . These assumptions are highly restrictive as they do  not 
allow individuals to be affected by  both the media and by economic data , and because they  do not 
allow for non -neutral  media content. Other  studie s quantify media content  by classifying media items  
into classes based  on sentiment , i.e., whether the texts have a positive  or negative  tone. One approach 
is to classify the headlines  and economic content on the front pages of influential newspapers  with 
respect to their sentiment ( Hester & Gibson 2003;  Doms & Morin 2004;  Birz & Lott 2011) . This 
approach relies  heavily  on the assumption that media content can be reduced to headline s and front -
page material  without any substantial loss of sentiment information . Such an assumption  is not likely 
to hold in general,  because headlines  and front pages  are tools that media outlets use to capture 
individuals’ attention  and thus differ from media items’ actual sentiment  (Andrew 2007) . 
 
We follow a strand in the literature that classifies media items’  actual  textual content  (Nadaeu et al. 
1999;  Fogarty 2005 ; Soroka 2006;  Goidel et al . 2010;  Lamla & Maag 2012;  Lamla & Lein 2014;

 3.1 Data Collection  
We use media  data from the Retriever database , which contains most editorial media  items  published 
in print and online in Sweden since the 1980s. The database contains around one hundred million 
searchable media items published by a wide range of media outlets including  all the major 
newspapers . Before the year 2000, the database consisted pr imarily of printed newspapers with 
nationwide coverage. From  the year  2000 and onwards, the database also includes media items 
published online. This caused the number of media outlets in the database to increase and changed the 
composition of media source s to include more  local daily newspapers, purely I nternet based news 
sites, weekly news magazines, trade magazines, union magazines  and public  authorities. The data 
contains information on whether media items are published in print or online which allows us to split 
the data accordingly. We are thus able to control for the effects of the influx of online media into the 
database in our analysis.   
 We are interested in downloading as many media items  with economic content  as possible . We thus 
use a  search query
1 in the Retriever search engine, which is based on an economic dictionary we have 
downloaded from www.ekonomifakta.se . This webpage presents information and data on matters of 
importance to the Swedish econo my and is run by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise ( Svenskt 
Näringsliv ) which is Sweden ’s largest employer organization. The dictionary contains 678 words and 
concepts used in the fields of economy, taxes, the labo ur market, energy, environment, 
entrepreneurship, education and the public sector. To download as many media items with economic 
content as possible from the Retriever database , we created our search query by requiring that at least 
one of the words in the dictionary is present in the media items’ texts. However, this may cause us to download a substantial number of media items that do not have economic content due to the comprehensiveness of the Ekonomifakta dictionary. We thus remove those items that do not have 
economic content at a later stage when we classify our downloaded media items using supervised machine learning.

 One potential problem that arises when using the Ekonomifakta dictionary is that some words do not 
have explicit economic meaning when taken out of context. For example, if an environmental word 
occurs in a text, without any other economic words being present, this would not be a good indication 
that the media item has any economic relevance. Another potential issue with our search query is that 
the economic terms in the d ictionary may give hits for very short economic media items that merely 
report on one topic without any sentiment. Finally, the query may result in media items that report 
economic matters in a naïve way that lacks realism compared to what the economic dat a actually 
suggests. Short newspaper notes may, for example, report that inflation is increasing or falling without 
presenting any information on other economic variables such as unemployment or GDP. Such media 
items do not contain any sentiment because hi gher and lower inflation can be both negative and 
positive for the economy. Chronicles published in small online publications may, on the other hand, 
report on a plenitude of economic conditions. These media items may report on economic conditions 
in a naï ve way compared to other media items that are published by the larger and better funded media 
outlets. The sentiments of these naïve media items may thus make our measure less precise since they are likely to deviate from what the economic data actually su ggests.  
 We mitigate these issues by augmenting our search query to require that the word “economy” (“ekonomi ” in Swedish) is present in the texts together with either of the words “forecast” (“ prognos ” 
in Swedish) or “report” (“ rapport ” in Swedish). This increases the probability that the search query 
returns media items that report on several economic conditions in the same text, since they will be 
reporting on findings and statements stemming from reports and forecasts made by economic bodies 
such as com mercial banks and the central bank ( Riksbanken ). Such reports and forecasts are typically 
based on the outcomes of econometric models using economic data, and are thus well anchored in 
economic reality. These documents report general economic conditions, a lbeit with a main focus on 
one economic variable such as inflation or the interest rate (Blinder et al . 2001).
2 Another advantage 
of this approach  is that we ensure  that our media items  are especially suited  for testing H ypotheses  2 
and 3. Here, we use  consumer sentiment  data on individuals’ retrospective evaluations  of recent 
economic outcomes  and their prospective expectations about future economic conditions . There is thus  ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,one ek oom  ka for anotr nally short suchronitse t      riksbank esutse blind anotr re tre

 symmetry  between our media data and the consumer sentiment data in the sense that  media items 
containing the word “ forecast ” are prospective  as they primarily deal with future economic 
developments , and media items containing the word “ report ” are retrospective in the sense that they 
primarily deal with realized economic outcomes.  
 
Some economic events, such as economic crises, have greater impact on the economic media than 
other events. The Retriever search engine allows us to measure the impact of economic events on the 
economic media because many media items reporting a particular ev ent are re -reported by several 
other media outlets. A typical example of this is news items reported by Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå 
(TT) that have a big impact on the news media as a whole in times of major economic events such as 
economic crisis. This is especially true in the initial stages of unrave lling events, when many smaller 
daily newspapers struggle to keep up with the larger  and better -funded newspapers.  
 
Our search query resulted in 179 ,846 media items published in print and online. The Retriever home 
page delivered the data in text files in batches of max 500 media items per file. We parsed the 
information in these text fil es into separate pieces of information  so that we could separately handle 
the media items’ header, body of text, source, publication date/time and place of publishing 
(print/online). This allows us to split the data based on the parsed information and cond uct our 
analysis on different subsets of the data.  
 
3.2 Supervised Machine Learning  
Supervised machine learning (SML) is a set of techniques often used to classify large bodies of data. Typical applications of SML are email spam filters (emails being spam or non -spam), topic -specific 
search engines (document topics, e.g. , economics, polit ics, sports, etc.) and detecting sentiment in 
consumer reviews (Manning et al . 2010). SML techniques are often deployed in situations where 
manual classification of data is not possible due to time and resource constraints. These techniques 
have received l imited attention by researchers in the field of economic media sentiment detection, with 
some promising exceptions ( e.g. Boydstun et al.  2018).  ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,some t rieved tid ni pnas telegram by  our t rieved   suvised machine learni suvised typical manni tse boyd stun

","12 
 Most of the SML -techniques used for text classification work on training data, which consist of text 
items that are pre -classified by humans, to estimate a probability model. These SML -techniques use 
the estimated probability model for out -of-training -data classification,  i.e., to assign a class to text 
items that were previously unseen by the probability model. One  can evaluate the accuracy of the 
probability model by partitioning the training data into a training set, which is used to estimate the 
probability model, and a validation set, which is disjoint with the training data set and is used to 
evaluate the accur acy of the models’ predictions. This process is known as K -fold cross validation 
(Sebastiani 2002), and can be used once or several times.  
 
3.2.1 Training Data  
We randomly select a set of news items from the economic media items we have downloaded, and 
manually classify them into three groups: (i) positive sentiment, (ii) negative sentiment or (iii) 
irrelevant .3 This process results in 31 % of the media items in the test data being classified as positive 
sentiment, 29 % classified as negative sentiment a nd 40 % classified as irrelevant. The relatively high 
number of irrelevant media items in the test data is most likely due to the fact that we use a 
comprehensive search query to retrieve our data from the Retriever database. This class consists of 
media items that do not have any economic content. A frequent kind of irrelevant media item in the 
test data are TV -guides that end up in the search results because they contain an occasional word from 
the search query.  
 
We classify documents as negative sentime nt if, for example, they report on the consequences of 
economic crises, rising unemployment and/or a slowdown in GDP  growth. A typical example of a 
media item which we classify as negative is a report  of a forecast from a commercial bank stating that 
the economy is losing its momentum or that a trade organization for the construction industries has 
released a report stating that building investments are down. We classify documents as positive 
sentiment if, for example, they report falling unemployment, incr eased GDP  growth or general 
improvements of business cycle conditions .4 A typical example of a media item which we classify as 
positive economic sentiment is a report from the Swedish N ational Institute for Economic Research ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,most tse one  sebastiatr articial intellence ni data   t rieved     institute economic research

 saying that investments are gro wing in the economy, or that a commercial bank issued a forecast 
which predicts a recovery in the economy. However, media items do not have to report directly about 
macroeconomic business cycle conditions to be classified as positive or negative sentiment.  If, for 
example, a media item reports that a major company is laying off (hiring) workers due to a decrease (increase) in demand, then we classify this as negative (positive) economic sentiment. Such actions 
taken by individual firms contribute to the general business cycle conditions via an increase (decrease) 
in unemployment.  
 
We take into account the fact that Sweden is a small and export -dependent economy which is sensitive 
to changes in foreign demand for goods and services (Gylfason 1999). We do thi s by classifying 
economic media items that report on improved (worsened) economic conditions in foreign economies 
as positive (negative) sentiment, since increases (decreases) in demand in foreign economies are likely 
to cause an increase (decrease) in the export of goods and services from Sweden to foreign countries. 
This will increase (decrease) aggregate demand in the small export -dependent Swedish economy, and 
therefore affect the Swedish economy in a positive (negative) way.  
 One potential issue with o ur manual sentiment classification is that it may deviate  from the general 
public ’s perception of economic media sentiment in a systematic way. This is not likely to cause any 
substantial problems in our analysis, however. Many experimental studies that investigate to what extent individuals agree on sentiment in texts find an inter -annotator agreement rate in the range of 80 
% – 90 % ( e.g. Wilson et al.  2005; Bermingham &  Smeaton 2010; Jain &  Nemade 2010). The inter -
annotator agreement rate is even higher when annotators are required to report on texts’ sentiment at a low-granular level, i.e. , when annotators are not given any option to express their opinion of the 
strength of a text’s sentime nt. The highest agreement among annotators,  i.e., when all annotators agree 
completely, is achieved when an experiment requires annotators to conduct binary classification, i.e. , 
to classify texts as positive or negative sentiment without a neutral option (O’Hare et al.  2009).

 3.2.2 Prediction Model  
We use our training data to build a prediction model using the multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier 
(NB). NB is a robust and parsimonious SML -technique that assigns a class to a given text document 
by finding t he maximum a posteriori  class under the assumption that each word occurs independently 
of all other words in a language. In practice, this means that NB assigns a document, which is not  in 
the training data, to the class which has the largest sum of log pr ior probability and log conditional 
probabilities across words in the document s. NB calculates the prior probability for a document 
belonging to a particular class as the relative frequency of documents that belong to the class in  the 
training data. The conditional probabilities for words in a class are calculated as the relative frequency 
of words in documents belonging to the class in  the training data.  The NB classifier  computes  the 
probability of a  class  c, given a document  d, as proportional to the product of the prior probability of a 
document class P(c) and the probabilities of each word, w, of which there are n in a document , d, 
given c:  
 
P(c|d) ∝ P(c)   ∏ P(wk|c) 1≤k≤ nd (1) 
  
Here, P(wk|c) is a measure of how much evidence wk contributes to the class, c , being correct for the 
document, d. We are interested in finding the maximum a posteriori  class , cmap, for a given document . 
This means that we  can formulate the classification problem  as: 
 
cmap=arg max
c∈CP(c|d) =arg max
c∈CP(d|c)P(c)/𝑃𝑃(𝑑𝑑) =arg max
c∈CP(d|c)P(c) (2) 
  
Where the first equality is due to Bayes’ Rule,  and where the second equality comes from the fact that 
P(d), the probability of a document,  is the same across all documents.  Here, P(d|c)  is the probability 
of a document, conditional on  a class , c. Estimating this probability is not feasible  in practice  because 
it requires that one observes each possible sequence of words  for each class , which implies that on e 
needs  a near -infinite number of documents in the test data . We thus make the conditional ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,predim na basit t re   wre basrule re estimati

we make a positional independence assumption , i.e. that the probability of a word, w, conditional on a

our NB -model classifies media items into the classes (i) –(iii) with an estimated  overall accuracy of

Boydstun et al. 2018). Our NB -model is likely to classify a document containing words like “strong” , 
“good”  and “growth”  as positive sentiment rather than negative sentiment. Our NB -model is, 
however, likely to classify a document containing words like “weaker” , “reduced”  and “recession”  
as negative sentiment rather than positive sentiment .6  
 
3.2.3 Classified Data  
We use our NB -model to classify the full sample of media items which results in 31% economic 
media items classified as positive sentiment, 24 % classified as negativ e sentiment and 45 % classified 
as irrelevant. The ratio of positive media items in the full data  set is the same as in the test data. The 
ratios of negative and irrelevant data are , however , different. The test data contained 5  percentage 
points  fewer irrelevant media items and 5  percentage points  more negative media items. This 
difference is most likely due to a random overrepresentation of the negative class in the test data ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,place wcw wcw  tse  jorda   servant guerrero boyd stuour our assied data  t t t

 There is, however, a wide variation in the average length of the outlets’ items, as illustrated in Figure 
3. Most of the outlets in the data publish text items that are shorter than 1 ,000 words on average. This 
indicates that most of the media outlets in the data are news agencies that frequently publish short 
stories about economic developments. The media outlets that on average publish the longest texts 
(>1,000 words) are different from newspapers as they publish in -depth analyses, forecasts  and minutes 
from board meetings , etc. at a low frequency.

In our analysis, we split the media items into six  different subgroups in order to investigate if they

Printed media will probably follow stricter editorial procedures than online media , which are 
published more frequently than printed media. Their sentiment may differ from online media, which 
are published continuously throughout the day, therefore not allowing as  strict an editorial process as 
can be expected in printed media. The seco nd distinction we make concerns geographical affiliation,

 only local coverage. We define nationwide coverage as media outlets that do not have an explicit lo cal 
affiliation in their name or in the ir description of themselves as stated on their homepage. This split 
allows us to identify differences in media sentiment that stem from the local media, which is more 
likely to be more concerned with local economic c onditions, and nationwide economic media 
sentiment, which is more likely to report nationwide economic conditions. The local media may thus 
affect individuals’ opinions and expectations about their own personal economic situation, since local 
economic conditions are more likely to be closely linked to individuals ’ personal economic conditions 
than nationwide economic conditions. The third distinction we make is based on two features of the 
media outlets that can be found in the data. The first feature is th e media outlets’ publication 
frequency,  i.e., how many media items they have in the data. The second feature is the media outlets’ 
average number of words per media item in the data7. This will allow us to investigate the differences 
between media items th at publish in -depth analysis, i.e. , that are published infrequently and are 
relatively long, and media items that are published frequently with a relatively shallow content.  
 
3.3 The Economic Media Sentiment Index  
We calculate an Economic Media Sentiment Index (EMSI) by taking monthly averages of the ratio of 
the net of positive and negative media items to total number of economic media items for each month, 
according to the following formula.  
EMSI t=Dt-1�netdDt
d=1 (8) 
 
Where d is day in the month t  with Dt number of days in the month, and where:  
netd=�# positived - # negatived
# positived + # negatived, if # positived + # negatived > 0
                    0                       , if # positived + # negatived = 0 (9) 
 
This gives us an index which ranges from -1 when there is only negative news during the month, to 
+1, when there is only positive news. In our data , the index has a mean value of 0.06 with a standard ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,  t t t t  t economic media sentiment inx  economic media sentiment inx dt dt wre dt  in

 deviation of 0.18. Figure 4 shows the development of the economic media sentiment index for the 
sample period. The EMSI is relatively volatile with monthly variations of +/ - 50% being common. The 
index also contains some longer cycles, which are illustrated in the figure by using a 12- month centred 
moving average. In general , the longer cycle follows the business cycle, with peaks around the dot -
com boom in 2000, before the international financial crisis in 2008 and during the recovery from the 
financial crisis in 2010. We can observe the largest troughs in the i ndex during the international 
financial crisis of 2008/09 and the Euro -zone  debt crisis in 2012/13. Other troughs in the EMSI are 
small in comparison with the financial and Euro crises, for example the trough following the dot -com 
boom and the one following the Swedish financial crisis in the early 1990s. In fact, the amplitude of 
the cycles appears to have increased over time. This may be due to more volatile economic conditions 
and/or to changed media behaviour where media outlets report economic events w ith stronger 
sentiment. Such a change in media behaviour may be the result of including media items published online after the year 2000, which do not necessarily follow the same editorial procedures as traditional 
printed media.

 Figure 5 shows the development of the 12- month centred moving averages of the printed media and 
the online media, together with the output gap as calculated by using Swedish quarterly real GDP from 
the St. Loui s Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)  database (we have interpolated to obtain 
monthly observations and used the HP -filter to estimate the output gap) . Printed and online EMSI 
follow the development of the output gap relatively closely throughout the sample, with troughs and 
peaks occurring around the same time as for the output gap. The output gap shows clear signs of 
increased volatility from 2006 onwards. Most of this volatility is due to the financial crisis. If we 
disregard the 2006–2011 period, w hich covers and is adjacent to the financial crisis, we do not observe 
any signs of increased volatility in the output gap. The online EMSI is, however, more positive than the printed EMSI particularly during the 2000–2005 and 2011–2017 periods. The increa sed variance 
of total EMSI may thus come from both increased volatility in the economy during the 2006–2012-
period and also from the influx of online media in the data. Another observation is that both online and 
printed EMSI appear to lead the development  in the output gap, particularly for the 2006–2011 time 
periods. Both print and online EMSI reach a pre -financial -crisis peak prior to 2007, while the output 
gap peaks after 2007. The EMSI measures and the output gap hit their lowest level at the end of 2008, 
and the EMSI measures recover more quickly from the trough than the output gap. This pattern, with 
EMSI reaching peaks and troughs before the output gap, is present throughout the sample but is more pronounced after the year 2000, and is stronger for online EMSI than for print EMSI. This may be due 
to changed media behavio ur, where the media reports more about forecasts than previously.

 Figure 5. 12- month Centred Moving Averages of Printed and Online EMSI and the Output Gap  
 
The different subgroups of the EMSI develop similarly to total EMSI during the sample period. Figure 
6 shows that the development of nationwide, local, printed, online, frequent and infrequent EMSI 
develop in cyclical movements that are similar to those for total EMSI. The volati lity of the subgroups 
are different, however. Printed media appears to be more volatile than nationwide media. This may be 
because nationwide media are better funded than other media outlets that are published  in print, and 
may thus present a more balanced economic sentiment in their media items. The subgroups of EMSI  
(local, online and infrequent) , which enter into the data in the year 2000, are more volatile at the 
beginning of the 2000s than later in the sample period. This may be because the number of online 
media outlets in the Retriever database has gradually increased from the year 2000 and onwards as the importance of online media increased in the media landscape. This should have a stabilizing effect on 
our EMSI measure since the larger number of o nline media outlets makes the EMSI less sensitive to

4. Data on Individuals’ Opinions and Expectations  
Having quantified the economic media data, we now turn to the measurement of individuals’ 
evaluations and expectations of economic conditions. Researchers often measure these by using 
survey data ( e.g. Boydstun et al . 2018;  Fogarty 2005 ; Hester & Gibson 2003). We use data on 
individuals ’ opinions and expectations about economic conditions that are collected in the Swedish 
Household Purchasing Plan’s survey ( Hushållens inköpsplaner , henceforth referred to as “the 
survey”), which is a monthly survey conducted by the National Institute of Ec onomic Research 
(NIER).8 The survey is representative of the adult population and each wave includes 1, 500 
respondents .9.The survey contains  more than 16 questions about the household’s opinions concerning 
their current and future consumption and their opi nions about current and future economic conditions. 
Van Raaij and Gianotten (1990) have shown  that questions in consumer sentiment surveys can be 
divided into two main groups : questions that represent the individual ’s sentiment about their own 
economic con ditions and questions that represent the individual’s sentiment about the nation ’s overall 
(macro) economic conditions. In order to make our analysis as general as possible, we have  thus -0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6

One set of survey questions asks individuals to state their  expectations about the development of their 
own private economic situation and the macroeconomic situation during the upcoming 12 months 
(ownFuture and sweFuture). Another set of questions asks respondents how they evaluate the 
development of their own ec onomic situation and the macroeconomic situation during the past 12

individual ’s expectations and evaluations of past economic developments are caused by the EMSI. 
Respondents can give one out of six predefined answers to the questions. These are presented in T able 
1, and range from very negative (A1) to very positive (A5), including a neutral option (A3) and the 
option to report a lack of knowledge (A6). In our econom etric models, we use the average of within

 4.1 Macroeconomic Data  
We need to control for macroeconomic variables in our analysis in order to isolate the sentiment that 
the news media adds when reporting economic conditions. We therefore include a set of key 
macroeconomic variables in our regression models. These macroeconomic variables are selected in 
order to capture the most important variations in the business cycle, the financial markets and 
exogenous shocks that hit the economy at random.  
 
We use quarterly real GDP which we dow nload from  the St. Louis FRED database as a measure of the 
business cycle in terms of economic activity. We interpolate this variable to obtain monthly 
observations and estimate the output gap using the HP -filter , which is a very common approach in the 
literature (Ravn &  Uhlig 2002) . Interpolating the GDP  data may introduce some measurement error in 
the data  (Friedman 1962) . However, this measurement error is not likely to be a major problem in our 
analysis since GDP is a variable that changes slowly with relatively little variation between quarter s. 
The variation  between months is thus also likely  to be relatively small and thus the measurement error 
as well.  Furthermore,  the media items in our data report findings from reports and forecasts published 
by economic bodies. Some of these reports and forecasts use models that also include past values of 
interpolated GDP from quart erly to monthly frequency, together with other key economic indicators 
available at monthly frequency, to forecast current and future GDP ( e.g. Mitchell et al . 2005; 
Altissimo et al . 2010). Using the monthly interpolated GDP in our analysis should therefor e not 
deviate systematically from what is being done in these reports and forecasts. This is especially so 
since we furthermore use monthly data available from statistics Sweden (SCB) for the unemployment 
rate (to account for business cycle fluctuations), and for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate 
the yearly inflation rate.   
We include two measures of exogenous shocks in our model. Firstly, we use monthly oil prices from 
the World Bank, which we convert to year -on-year percentage changes in real v alues, and secondly 
the monthly SEK/EUR -exchange rate from the Swedish Riksbank. Both of these variables may be 
important for explaining individuals’ expectations and perceptions of economic circumstances as well ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,maoeconomic data   tse  st louis  r uh l interpolatfriedmat furtr some mitcll alt is simo usi  sconsumer price inx  rstly world bank  riksbank both

 as being important for  the supply side of t he economy. Individuals tend to attach a symbolic value to 
the national exchange rate , which may affect their perception of the performance of the macro 
economy (Hobolt & Leblond 2009). The oil price directly affects individual s’ personal economic 
situation through the price of petrol used for private transport (Johnson &  Lamdin 2012).  
 
We use the monthly stock prices in terms of the OMXS30 index from Nasdaq OMX Nordic, which are 
transformed to real values using the CPI and then converted to year -on-year percentage changes. Stock 
prices are likely to matter both for individuals’ perceptions of their own personal economic situation 
and the nationwide economic situation. Swedish households’ participation in the stock market is high , 
with 45% of households owning stocks either directly as a part of their savings portfolio or indirectly 
through shares in mutual funds (Almenberg &  Dreber 2015). Stock prices may also matter for 
individuals’ perceptions and expectations concerning the future of the macro economy, since stock prices tend to lead the development of the real economy (Fama 1990; Schwert 1990). We henceforth 
prefix all macroeconomic variables that we calculate using year -on-year percentage change with Δ%.  
 
4.2 Descriptive S tatistics  
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the variables that we include in our econometric models. EMSI 
ranges from - 0.51 to 0.47, which means that it is at most approximately half of the extreme values ( -1 
and 1) for this measure, i.e. , when the news media reports only negative or positive news items during 
all the days of the month. We further note that ownFuture, sweFuture and ownNow have positive 
averages, which indicates that individuals are, on average, optimistic  about the state of their own 
present and future economic situation and about  the future of the nationwide economic situation. 
However, the average net of replies to sweNow is negative, which indicates that individuals are, on 
average, pessimistic  when evaluating the state of the pres ent nationwide economic situation.  
 
The survey measures of individuals ’ own economic situation are  more stable than the survey measures

 standard deviations  of sweNow and sweFuture are more than twice as large as the standard deviations 
for ownNow and ownFuture. This indicates that individuals base their expectations and evaluations 
about the state of their own personal economic situation and the nationwide e conomic situation on 
information sets that are not identical. The information set used by individuals to form an opinion about their own personal economic situation is likely to be more precise and less volatile compared to 
the information used by individuals to form their opinions about the nationwide economy. It is thus 
likely that the media plays an important role for individuals’ expectations and opinions about the 
nationwide economy given the rather choppy development of EMSI presented in Figure 1.  The p-
values from the Au gmented Dickey -Fuller test  including a constant  shows that we reject the null of a 
unit root  at a 5% -level for all of our variables except the inflation rate . Although inflation may be 
nonstationary in theory,  it is counterintuitive th at the inflation rate is  nonstationary as it would imply , 
for example,  infinite hyperinflation.  A plausible  explanation for this result is that the Swedish central 
bank ( Riksbank en) was given an independent mandate to conduct monetary policy with an inflation 
target of 2%  in 1995.  This is likely to have  caused the inflation rate to move from a higher level of 
stationary inflation to a lower level after 1995. In our analysis , we thus use an inflation  rate which is 
demeaned with the pre - and post -1995 m eans for the respective periods. This inflation rate has a n 
ADF -test p -value of 0.045.

The correlations in Table 3 confirm the obser ved pattern in Figures 3 and 4, i.e. , that EMSI is 
correlated with the business cycle. The correlation between EMSI and the output gap is 0.30 and the 
correlation between EMSI and unemployment is - 0.23. The EMSI is more volatile compared to the 
macroeconom ic variables, which may explain the relatively weak correlations. Correlations based on a 
12-month centred moving average of EMSI are more highly correlated with the macroeconomic 
variables (0.43 with the output gap and - 0.35 with unemployment). EMSI is po sitively correlated with 
all of the net of individuals’ replies to the survey questions. The highest correlation, between EMSI 
and individuals ’ evaluation of the current developments of the Swedish economy (sweNow), is 0.44, 
and is 0.60 for the 12 -month ce ntred moving average of EMSI. The strength of the correlation between 
the one month lag of EMSI and the survey-  and macro variables is similar to the strength of the

5. Results  
5.1 Test of Hypothesis  1 
We can now test Hypothesis  1, that economic media is not neutral  and therefore publishes unequally 
many items with positive and negative sentiment.  As our data  consists of monthly observations 
spanning 24 years , it includes  several booms and busts in the real economy . We thus expect  a neutral 
media to publish an equal number of media items with positive and negative tone  and a non- neutral 
media to publish an unequal number of media items with positive and negative tone . We thus test 
Hypothesis  1 by statistically  testing  if the mean of EMSI is significantly  different from zero. Table 4 
shows the sample means and t -ratios  calculated  using OLS with the EMSI as dependent variable and a 
constant as independent variable , using robust standard errors  (Newey & West 1987) . Table 4 also  
includes tests  for our  six different subgroups of EMSI including sources with nationwide coverage, 
local coverage, online and printed modes of publication and frequent and infrequent publications. We 
can see that the total EMSI, together with five  out of the six  subgroups, are posit ive and significantly 
different from zero, causing us to accept Hypothesis  1. The interpretation of the estimated mean values 
is straightforward: a positive  and significant  mean value means that the number of positive media ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,table correlatns contemaneous one month lag month centred movi ge month centred movi ge  future  future output gap uemploy rate inflatrate o price stock pricresults test sis  sis as   sis table newly st table  sis t

Next, we investigate the difference in means and variances between the subgroups presented in  Table 
5. Firstly, we can note that economic news items that are published online have a predominately more positive tone than those publis hed in print. This difference could be due to the fact that traditional 
printed media employs a stricter editorial process and is published less frequently than online news 
media, causing the traditional media to present a more neutral version of economic conditions on 
average. We further note that the nationwide economic media is more positive than the local media. 
This could be due to the local media mainly re -reporting macroeconomic news from the nationwide 
media, to which it adds local economic news wit h a more negative tone. We find no significant 
difference between the variances of the different subgroups. This indicates that the sentiment of the subgroups react s to changes in economic conditions in a similar way, albeit with different averages.

5.2 Tests of Hypotheses 2 and 3  
We now turn to tests of H ypothesis 2, that individuals’ opinions and expectations about current and 
future economic conditions are Granger -caused by economic media content that is not motivated by 
economic data, and H ypothesis 3, that economic media content does not Granger -cause individuals’ 
opinions and expectations about their private economic situation. As both of these hypotheses regard 
causation of economic media on individuals’ expectations and evaluations  of economic circumstances , 
we evaluate them using a set of Granger -causality tests, see  Granger (1969).  
 
5.2.1 Granger -causality Tests  
We acknowledge the fact that Granger -causality is not a test of true causality because  it can only 
establish a causal relationship between two variables, X  and Y, in the sense that one variable tends to 
occur before the other  one in time. Thus, the Granger -causality test cannot confirm that there is a true 
causal relationship between X  and Y but only rule out that there is no true causal relationship between 
them . We furthermore  acknowle dge that the Granger -causality test ( i) does not rule out the possibility 
that two variables X  and Y are caused by a third potentially unobserved variable Z  and (ii) it does not 
account for instantaneous causality between X  and Y (Maziarz 2015). Both the E MSI and the general 
public are likely to respond to changes in economic data. Any one -way Granger -causality established 
between EMSI and individuals’ expectations and evaluations of economic conditions may thus be due ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,table snicance means dference dference print online natlocal shallow ep t t tests s   as    tests       ma zia rz both any

 to macroeconomic data and therefore no t a true causal relationship. This is not likely to cause any 
problems in our analysis because we include key macroeconomic variables covering the most 
important sectors of the macro economy as controls in our regressions. It is thus likely that any 
Grange r-causality we can establish between our variables of interest does not com e from an 
unobserved variable that we do not capture with the macroeconomic variables. We test if a causal 
relationship exists between our survey measures and EMSI using the followi ng specification:  
 
surveyt= α + �β0,k × EMSI t-kk=K
k=1 + ��βi,k × macrovariable i,t-kk=K
k=1i=6
i=1 + �β7,k × surveyt-kk=K

k=1 + ��βi,k × macrovariable i,t-kk=K
k=1i=6
i=1 + �β7,k × EMSI t-kk=K
k=1 + εt (11) 
 We determine the number of lags, K, in equations 10 and 11 individually by selecting the most 
parsimonious specification that do es not exhibit autocorrelation in the residuals. If the coefficient for 
EMSI is significant on at least a 5% -level in equation 10, then, we can conclude that EMSI Granger 
causes individuals’ opinions and expectations about economic conditions, rather  than this coming 
from our economic control variables. We can determine the direction of causation by investigating the significance of the coefficient estimates for our survey variables in equation 8 . If all of them are 
insignificant, then we can conclude that there is a one -way Granger causal relationship going from 
EMSI to our survey variables, we denote this result as EMSI 
→ survey.  
 
If, however, the coefficients in equation 8  are also significant, then we can conclude that there is a 
two-way Granger causal relationship between EMSI and our survey variables, we denote this result 
EMSI ↔ survey . If we observe that the coefficient for EMSI is insignificant in equation 10 and that 
the coefficient for our survey variables is significant in equation 8 then we can conclude that there is a

The results from our Granger -causality tests presented in Table 6 show a clear pattern. Four out of 
seven tests result in one -way Granger -causality between EMSI and sweNow and three out of seven 
tests result in no Granger -causality between EMSI and sweNow.  These results give support to 
Hypothesis  2 because the news media Granger -causes individuals’ opinions about the macro economy

the other direction from the survey variables to EMSI in terms of sweFuture → EMSI , ownFuture → 
Online  and ownNow → Frequent . These results are, however not robust across different subgroups of 
EMSI.  Hypothesis 3 is supported by the results presented in Table 6 since EMSI does not Granger -
cause ownFuture and ownNow. This result indicates that individuals do not base their opinions and expectations about their own economic situation on information  published by the economic media.  
 
Individuals’ opinions about the current state of economic conditions are Granger -caused  by EMSI and 
Δ% Stock prices. The results for equation 10 with sweNow as dependent variable are presented in 
Table 7. These show that  EMSI is significant for 4 out of 7 specifications with estimates in the range

 The estimated coefficients for the one period lagged values of sweNow range from 0.90–0.92. These 
estimates have 95 % confidence intervals that do not include unity, a  result which is further reinforced 
by the fact that the Augmented Dickey Fuller test rejects the null hypothesis of a unit root for all of our 
survey measures .10 The residuals in the regressions presented in Table 7 are not autocorrelated  and the 
results are robust to adding more lags of the dependent variable and the independent variables.  
 
The output gap Granger -causes  EMSI, online EMSI and nationwide EMSI in a majority of the 
regression specification s of equation 8 , i.e., with our 7 dif ferent EMSI measures as dependent 
variables and our 4 different survey variables as independent variables using the same macroeconomic 
control variables in each regression. Figure 7 presents the number of regressions for which lags of the 
macroeconomic con trol variables are significant. The lags of the output gap are significant in a 
majority of the regressions with EMSI, nationwide EMSI and local EMSI as dependent variable. 
EMSI is also Granger -caused  by Δ%  Stock prices in 3 out of 4 regressions, which sho ws that EMSI is 
Granger -caused  both by economic data which changes frequently and infrequently. This indicates that 
the media are reporting both on economic events that change on a daily basis such as the stock market , 
as well as changes in other more long -term economic conditions that affect the real economy.  
 
The subgroups of EMSI are Granger -caused  by different macroeconomic variables. Online EMSI is 
Granger -caused  by the output gap,  while printed EMSI is Granger -caused  by measures of exogenous 
supply -side shocks in terms of the SEK/EUR -exchange rate and Δ%  Oil price. The nationwide EMSI 
is Granger -caused  by the output gap,  while the local EMSI is Granger -caused  by unemployment. This 
suggests that local media report on t opics that are directly linked to individuals ’ own financial 
situation to a greater extent than nationwide media, which instead focuses on economic conditions that 
affect the macroeconomic situation and thus have a weaker direct link to individuals ’ own ec onomic 
situation.

The general picture is that EMSI is Granger -caused  by data on economic conditions and not by 
individuals’ expectations and opinions about economic conditions. The results thus indicate that EMSI 
is Granger -caused  by economic conditions and that the EMSI affects individuals’ perception of 
macroeconomic conditions. These are, however, not Granger -caused  by economic data apart from

 5.2.2 Contemporaneous Effects  
We would ideally like to conduct Granger -causality tests using data with a higher frequency than 
monthly. The macroeconomic data does not allow for this, however, and any attempt at identifying 
Granger -causality using, for example , daily data will thus suf fer from the unobserved variable problem 
described in section 5.2. We can, however, get an indication of whether a causal relationship exists 
within a month, albeit without pinpointing the direction of the causality. We do this by running the 
following reg ression:  
 
surveyt = α + β0 × EMSI t + ∑ βi × macrovariable t6
i=1  + ∑ β7,k × surveyt-kk=Kk=1 + εt (12) 
 
Here, we include the same macro variables as  in equation s (10) and ( 11). Although the output gap and 
the unemployment and inflation rate s are not available in real time , they may act as proxies for  other, 
unobserved information about economic conditions  that individuals have access to. Including the 
macro  variables thus allows us to isolate the contemporaneous correlation between EMSI and  our 
survey variables . We again  determine the number of lags, K , individually by selecting the most 
parsimonious specification that does not exhibit autocorrelation in the residuals.  If the coefficient for 
EMSI is significant in equation 12, then it is an indication that EMSI affects individuals’ opinions and 
expectations about economic conditions, other than that coming from our economic control variables. 
We cannot say anything about the direction of causality, i.e.  whether EMSI causes our  survey 
measures or if our survey measures cause EMSI or if they both cause each other. We are, however, 
able to rule out that EMSI and our survey measures are unrelated within months. Table 8 presents the 
regression results for model 3 :11

 variable compared to the regression with sweFuture as dependent variable. T his result agrees with the 
contemporaneous correlations presented in Table 2 , which are stronger between EMSI and sweNow 
than between EMSI and sweFuture. This indicates that individuals  may use the economic media to 
form an opinion about the current state of the Swedish economy to a greater extent than when they 
form their expectations about its future developments.  
 
The estimated coefficients for the year -on-year percentage change of the stock market index are 
significant and positive for all the survey v ariables. This is a reasonable result given that stock prices 
are a leading indicator for the macro economy and also important for individuals’ personal savings. 
The estimated coefficients for the unemployment rate are significant at a 5 -% level for ownNow  and 
ownFuture but not for sweNow and sweFuture. This implies that individuals’ perception of their own 
economic situation correlates with the unemployment rate. This may be due to the fact that 
individuals’ perception of their own economic situation is mo stly determined by their employment 
status; if people expect to become unemployed, then they tend to perceive and expect the future of their personal economic situation to deteriorate.  
 The estimated coefficients for the inflation rate are negative and significant in the regression with sweNow and ownNow as dependent variables at the 5 % and 10 % level respectively. This shows that 
individuals tend to become more pessimistic about the cur rent state of economic conditions as 
inflation increases. The estimates for the year -on-year percentage change of the oil price is negative 
and significant at the 5  % level for sweFuture and ownNow. This indicates that individuals tend to 
become more  negative if oil price increase s, both about their own economic situation and about the 
nationwide economic situation. This is an expected result since changes in oil price s can be the result 
of an  exogenous supply -side shock , but they also  affect expenses  for households via the price of petrol 
used for private transport.

 6. Conclusion 
We develop a new  measure on Swedish economic media sentiment using a supervised machine 
learning technique.  Our measure is calculated based on the sentiment of  the full textual content of  
179,846 media items, stemming from 1 ,071 unique media outlets including the major nationwide 
newspapers, local newspapers and online news during the 1993–2017 period. The  measure has more 
good characteristics  compared to other studies  that leave out important sentiment information  or are 
limited to a few time periods and/ or media outlets . We use our measure to  test three hypotheses 
regarding how the media report s on the economy, and how this  reporting affects individuals’  opinions 
and expectations. Our results support the second hypothesis ; that individuals’ opinions and 
expectations about current and future economic conditions are Granger -caused by economic media 
content that is not motivated by economic data . There is al so support for the third hypothesis ; that 
economic media content does not Granger -cause individuals’ opinions and expectations about their 
private economic situation . We accept  the first hypothesis ; that the economic media is not neutral  and 
therefore publ ishes unequally many items with positive and negative sentiment . We find that the 
economic media reports slightly more items with  positive  than negative sentiment  which  differs  to that 
found in the previous literature, which has  shown negative reporting  to be  more common than positive 
reporting  (Fogarty 2005; Arango- Kure et al. 2014; Boydstun et al . 2018) . These different results may 
be explained by the fact that Swedish media is different to media in other economies and that we have  
more data stemming from a large r set of media outlets  compared to other studies .  
 
We provide evidence that individuals ’ opinions and expectations about their own personal economic 
situation  are not Granger -caused  by the economic media sentiment  index. This implies that individuals 
use other sources of information for forming opinions  about their own economic situation. Individuals 
may do this because they have access to other sources of information that are more relevant  for their 
own personal economic situatio n. Alternatively,  individuals may be overconfident in their opinions 
and expectations  concerning their own economic situation in relation to the nationwide situation, ",2020-07-27T19:30:08Z,conus  our t  our  tre    fog party rae sure boyd stutse     individuals alternatively

 which may  cause individuals  to ignore information about macroeconomic conditions  that is  published 
by the media.  
 
Our results are in line with some of the previous literature , such as  Hester and Gibson (2003) , 
Boydstun et al . (2018)  and Lamla et al . (2019),  which have found that the public ’s perception of  
general  economic condition s is affected by economic media, controlling for macroeconomic data.  This 
indicates that the way the media frames news about economic conditions matter s for individuals’ 
perceptions about economic conditions . The general picture is thus that individuals’ perception of 
macroeconomic conditions is a reflection of the information presented to them  by the media . This is 
most likely  due to  individuals having few other information sources  available to them that they can use 
to form an opinion about macroeconomic conditions . The economic media sentiment index that we 
have developed  in this paper  may thus be  useful for forecasters who use data on individuals’ opinion s 
about macroeconomic conditions  in their models  for forecasting  monthly macroeconomic activity .

between increases in levels and , for example,  percentage rates. The interpretation of the ↑(↓) symbols for the 
SEK/EUR variable is a depreciation  (appreciation) of the SEK in relation to other currencies.  In this table, the 
contributions are isolated, i.e. keeping everything else constant. In practice, however, most documents contain 
information about several of these variables . Sentiment classification is carried out by the author  based on the

Vi har fått många positiva signaler om att svensk ekonomi står starkt och positiva utfall om de 
offentliga finanserna, från både SCB och ESV. Det sade finansminister Magdalena Andersson till 
Nyhetsbyrån Direkt vid Socialdemokraternas partikongress i  Göteborg på måndagen.  
 
""Det är oerhört positivt att den aktiva politik regeringen  bedrivit för att få fler i jobb, sänka 
kostnaderna för migration och föra en stram finanspolitik, att det också gett resultat "", sade hon.  
 
Hur står sig regeringens  prognose r från i december?  
 
""Det kommer  jag att berätta på tisdag. Det är marknadspåverkande information och svarar jag nu då 
fethamnar jag i KU"", sade hon.  
 
I sin prognosuppdatering den 20 december var regeringens  BNP -prognos 2,4 procent för 2017 och 1,8 
procent  för 2018, medan det offentliga sparandet väntades visa ett underskott på 0,4 procent av BNP i 
år och ett överskott på 0,2 procent  nästa år. 
 
ESV:s senaste prognos , från den 6 april, visade ett överskott i det finansiella  sparandet på 0,3 procent  i 
år och 0 ,5 procent  nästa år.

individuals' expetations and perceptions about economic conditions. We test if
economic media sentiment Granger-causes individuals' expectations and opinions
concerning economic conditions, controlling for macroeconomic variables. We
develop a measure of economic media sentiment using a supervised machine
learning method on a data set of Swedish economic media during the period
1993-2017. We classify the sentiment of 179,846 media items, stemming from
1,071 unique media outlets, and use the number of news items with positive and
negative sentiment to construct a time series index of economic media
sentiment. Our results show that this index Granger-causes individuals'
perception of macroeconomic conditions. This indicates that the way the
economic media selects and frames macroeconomic news matters for individuals'
aggregate perception of macroeconomic reality.

economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such

On the basis of such modern value judgments, many countries are willing to implement measures such as lockdowns which clearly involve heavy economic losses—in order to save as many lives as possible. The Spanish influenza pandemic, which began in 1918 during World War I, resulted in cumulative deaths in the tens of millions throughout the world. In spite of considerable variation, even the smallest of the estimates was large enough to cause a temporary decline in the global population, which had previously been growing by around 13 million people per year (Roser [2020]).

However, there is already a long history of debate and controversy in the economic science on the relationship between public debt and future burdens. While it was Abba Lerner who sparked the idea (Lerner [1948]), the more general insights were gleaned from his approach and later organized in a textbook by Paul Samuelson (Samuelson [1967]).

However, once the epidemic or the pandemic becomes a reality, the situation changes drastically. The society is forced to realize that economic activity must be restricted more severely to strongly deter the spread of infection. In the early stages of infection control, wherein a growing number of infections are being gradually reported overseas, but have not been confirmed inland, governments tend to adopt “bolder measures.” These are aimed at strengthening the monitoring the influx of people from abroad, especially from countries and regions where the infection has been confirmed.

","cumulative number of deaths in the absence of any public intervention in all the phases. That is the MSL in equation (1), which denotes the maximum social loss. The shape of the epidemic curve will inevitably change if the government intervenes. However, the degree of change also depends on the phase of the infection. Figure 3 shows that, during the initial phase of the infection (P=1), the epidemic curve does not depend on the intensity of the public intervention. That is, if the intensity of the intervention in each phase is expressed as IP, then the peak in I1=1 is the same as that in I1=2.

","A similar dilemma could arise even during the phase where the spread of the infection has finally been deterred.

If, however, the government does not bear the weight of the economic losses and weakens its intervention prematurely (I3=1), then the spread of the infection may occur again. In such cases, it is likely that governments will be able to safely loosen the restrictions on people’s behavior only after a phase, such as P=4, where the intensity of public intervention will no longer be a major determinant of the epidemic curve.

Samuelson uses the example of wartime costs to illustrate this.

1 Introduction
Mathematical existence theories in various scientiﬁc ﬁelds are usually de-
veloped in Euclidian or more general topological spaces. The mathematicalentities whose “existences” are thereby established can not (in general) berepresented by ﬁnite numbers. This fact is of particular relevance for eco-nomics where many variables such as prices or product quantities (cars, etc.)are naturally expressed as integers or rational fractions. Further, opera-tional economic decisions invariably boil down to ﬁnite sequences of binarycomparisons among discrete alternatives. This is the case whenever an op-timization or equilibrium algorithm is used on a digital computer to solve agiven problem numerically, as in the case of “computable general equilibriummodels.” It is also the case when a person solves a problem by “thinking itthrough.” In economic problems, however, so long as they are formulated inﬁnite dimensional Euchidian spaces, the mathematically existing, real valued

","solutions can usually be approximated as closely as one likes by using ap-
propriate numerical techniques. In the rest of this paper such problems arecalled computational .
When a given real valued solution that is known to exist cannot be ap-
proximated, we shall say that it is not computational . The (perhaps clumsy)
term “computational” is necessary to distinguish the issue we have in mindfrom the closely related but deeper theory of “computability” which wouldcarry into more diﬃcult issues than need to be dealt with here. Besides, thathas already been done in the context of economics in a coruscating fashionby Velupillai (2000, forthcoming). The classical example of a computational
problem is the circumference of a circle of diameter, say D.E v e n i f Dis
an integer or a rational fraction, the circumference, C=πD, cannot be
computed exactly because πis an irrational number. Yet, because πcan be
computed to any desired degree of approximation—and has been to manythousands of places—the circumference is computational. The same can besaid, of course, for squaring the circle.
However, there are theoretical economic problems that have been solved
in real terms that are not computational in the sense of this paper and that
is what we deal with here. This is the case of chaotic trajectories in dynamiceconomic processes. It is well know that many such processes, such as over-lapping generations models, optimal and adaptive economizing growth mod-els, tˆatonnement, adaptive strategies in oligopolistic settings, and so forth,
exhibit chaos and statistical (ergodic) behavior robustly.
1The theorems that
enable these properties to be established live in the reals. A special case hasarisen in the economic models investigated by Nishimura and Yano (1995),Nishimura and Sorger (1996), and Hommes (1998). Although the models arediﬀerent, involving, respectively, growth, business cycle and market mecha-nisms, in each case the trajectories are generated by iterations of the tentmap.
In this paper we show why for allinitial conditions, forward iterations sim-
ulationed on a binary computer using this map must converge to an even,
periodic orbit even though for the same map deﬁned over the reals, such
convergence occurs with zero measure.
2Nonetheless, it is possible to con-
struct ﬁnite segments of trajectories that appear to be chaotic. Moreover,very small perturbations in the map can produce behavior that is highlyirregular—so that it appears to be chaotic—and also produces histogramsthat approximate the real theoretical results.

","We emphasize that the problem of computationality in our sense is well
known. Anyone working with computational algorithms is bound to runinto it sooner or later. For example, Stein and Ulam (1964, p.55) wroteabout “spurious convergence” to cycles in computer experiments with thesine function, even though there are no attractive ﬁxed points for the map inthe real numbers. Farebrother (1991), Kaplan and Glass (1995) and Hommes(1998)—and no doubt many others—observed the same phenomenon. Theirresults can be duplicated with, for example, the freely available programDynamics by Nusse and Yorke (1994). Still, students—even those who have
developed sophisticated programming skills—are usually baﬄed by computa-tional results that “contradict” the theory. Understanding this contradictionis crucial to guard against the tendency to reject one or the other of thecontending outcomes for the wrong reason. In short, when the theory is notconﬁrmed by the computer, both computer and real theory may be correct.It may just be that the latter is not computational!
Computer experimentation played a seminal role in the development of
chaos theory by Lorenz, whose work motivated the Li–Yorke theorems thatprovided constructive conditions for establishing the theoretical existenceand robustness of chaos in iterated maps. Thus, although the computer washelpful in discovering its existence, the results discussed here explain whychaos may sometimes not appear in computer experiments when supposedlyit should.
2 The General Problem
Letθ:X→Xbe a continuous map where Xis a closed, bounded interval
in the non–negative, real numbers, R. Such a map deﬁnes a discrete time
dynamic process
xt+1=θ(xt),t=0,1,... where x0=x∈X. (1)
The trajectory of such a map is deﬁned by τ(x): ={θt(x)}∞
t=0where θ0(x): =
x0andθ1(x): =θ(x) and θt(x)=θ(θt−1(x)). Thus,
xt=θt(x0),t=0,1,2,.... (2)

","such a map could generate chaotic trajectories (in R) and provided condi-
tions that the relative frequency distribution of values in any such trajectoryconverged to a unique, absolute, continuous, invariant measure or densityfunction. Given both conditions, chaos “occurs almost surely” for any initialcondition drawn at random in X.
To pin down exactly what is at the heart of the issue, a few basic prop-
erties of binary arithmetic need to be reviewed.

represented by a sequence of zeros and ones, the integer portion by a stringofpzeros or ones and the fractional part by a string of qzeros or ones where

The family of tent maps that underlie the economic models cited above is

For convenience, we consider examples where a= 2 and Nis a positive inte-
ger. Points that satisfy the Li–Yorke (1975) overshoot conditions that implythe existence of chaotic trajectories and periodic orbits of every periodicityare easily found. It is also relatively easy to show that the uniform distribu-tion on [0 ,N] is the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure for the
map θ:[ 0,N]→[0,N]. Those facts imply that (in the sense of the uniform
measure) for almost all x∈[0,N] the real trajectories are nonperiodic and
chaotic. See, for example, Day (1994, p.86). Here, then is an example ofexistence theory in the reals.
The ﬁrst iterate of the tent map is just equation (6). The second iterate

Nonetheless, round–oﬀ error must appear. Equation (7) indicates that
thenthiterate of x—regardless in which interval the initial condition lies—
contains the term 2nx. Clearly, the fractional part of the initial condition x
becomes shorter by one element with each multiplication by 2.7Therefore,
given the precision m,2nxmust become an integer for some n≤m. The
terms 2 iNare even integers. The other term is always an integer. The
diﬀerence of two integers is an integer and any integer multiplied by 2nis
even, so after some number of iterations, not more than m,θt(x) becomes
an even integer.

C.Fora=2and any integer Nand given ﬁnite precision m, every computed
trajectory of the tent map (6) converges in ﬁnite time to a periodic orbitconsisting of even integers.
Thus, viewing the computer itself as a dynamical system, the chaos that
occurs almost surely in the reals surely does not occur in the binary computer.
IfN= 1, then x
0is always a fraction, zero, or one. Zero is always a
ﬁxed point and θ(1) = 0. Since the fractional part goes to zero, we have the
following corollary.
D.IfN=1, every computed trajectory converges to zero in ﬁnite time.
This is the result obtained numerically by Kaplan and Glass (1995) and
observed by Hommes.
4 Numerical Examples
To better understand the above corollary, let us look at an example. Forsimplicity, assume that we work on a computer that stores binary numbersas a string of ﬁve binary digits and that the computer does not use binarynormalization, that is a binary number can start with a zero. For the initialdecimal value of x
0=0.4,equation (1) for N= 1 produces the periodic
sequence: 0.4, 0.8, 0.4, 0.8, 0.4, .... H o w e v e r , d u e t o t h e round oﬀ error in

Notice that the numerical binary sequence is not equivalent to the periodic
decimal sequence. Thus, instead of the 2–period orbit, {.4,.8}, we get the
sequence .375,.75,.5,1,0 converging to the stationary state zero.
Consider what happens when N= 100. We computed trajectories using
a C++ program that was compiled with the Borland C++ compiler installed
on a Pentium computer. It took only 16 iterations for the trajectory startingatx
0=6 7 .2 to converge to the integer 19 that then led to the 10-period
orbit{8,16,24,32,48,56,64,72,88,96}. Figure 1 displays this cycle with its
integer preimages. The lowest level of the tree contains odd integers. For theinitial value x
0=4.23828125 the trajectories converged to the integer 85 in
8 iterations, leading to the 2–period orbit {40,80}. Figure 2 gives this orbit
with its integer preimages.

Of course, the empirical densities for these orbits are just spikes over

trajectory quickly converged to the ﬁxed point of 0. See Figure 3. The integerpreimages of the three orbits and the cyclic points themselves account for allthe integers in [0 ,N]. Note that the elements of all three orbits are even.

In spite of these results it is possible to approximate chaos. We consider two

Figure 4: Histogram of Preimages for N= 100, x0=6 7.2
5.1 Constructing Preimages
Any point xin [0,N] has two preimages, each of which has two and so on of
the diﬀerence equation deﬁned by equation (6). At each point we can chooseone of the two preimages, ﬁnd its two preimages, choose one, and so on. Thiscan be done for some number say ptimes starting for any arbitrary number
¯x∈ρ
/parenleftBig
[0,N]/parenrightBig
in this way generating a sequence x0,x1,...,x p. If the choice
at each stage is “random” (say, by tossing a coin or using a computer random
number generator), this sequence will look more or less chaotic. Moreover,the sequence x
−p,x−p+1,...,x0will be a segment (possibly approximate) of
the real trajectory of (1) starting at the initial condition x−p. However, if we
begin computing the diﬀerence equation (3) from that same point, ( x−p), we
will not get the irregular segment just constructed, but will quickly convergeto an even cycle instead!
For example, we took the initial condition 67.2 and constructed in the
above manner 60,000 preimages to obtain the numerical density shown inFigure 4. It roughly approximates the uniform density, suggesting that theabsolutely continuous invariant density of the real trajectories is computa-
tional.
In spite of this, “chaotic” trajectories so constructed are not computa-
tional. The 60,000
thpreimage has a fractional part. Consequently, forward
computation from that point cannot follow the true constructed trajectory butwill quickly converge to an even integer cycle as predicted by the theorem and
shown in our examples of section 5.

While studying convergence to cycles for the map yt+1= sin πyt,0≤y≤
1, Stein and Ulam suggested inverse iterations with random choice betweenleft and right preimages. They point out that for many other maps, theprobability of convergence to low order cycles is very small. Even for thetent map, however, a good approximation to chaos can be attained in anotherway.
5.2 Noninteger domain
By setting Nto a non–integer value, we can keep xfrom converging quickly
to an integer. For example, choosing N= 100 .0001, rather than 100, as in
the previous experiment, gives us the distribution of Figure 5 ( x0=6 7 .2,
60,000 iterations). It is “close” to the uniform distribution that is predicted
by the theory for the tent map over the reals; and it resembles the distributionobtained using randomly selected backward iterates.
6 Discussion
In spite of the anomalies discussed above, experience shows that for mostmaps forward iterations generate trajectories that on a computer appear to
be chaotic when in theory they “should be:” irregular ﬂuctuations are gener-ated and they seem to obey the usual statistical laws of large numbers, eventhough ultimately the computations must be cyclic. Thus, the applied mod-
elscanprovide potential partial explanations for the ubiquitous irregularity

","of ﬂuctuation in economic data.9If we acknowledge that much (if not all)
economic data arise in the ﬁnitely representable rationals (as we must), thentheoretical results derived in the reals must be conceptual approximations ofthe real world economic phenomena. Thus, it seems to us that the “anomaly”analyzed here does not vitiate inferences based on the real theoretical prop-erties of a given economic model—at least not from a practical point of view.Real theory can still lead us to a better understanding of actual economicdata—most of which is, indeed, highly irregular. Of course, the theory isan
idealization. But that is a general characteristic of theory, the purpose ofwhich, after all, isto idealize, that is, to help us understand in the simpliﬁed
terms demanded by logic the unfathomably complex world around us. Lessappreciated is the possibility that a numerical analog of a theory could beentirely misleading, less appreciated, perhaps, because it seems not to occuroften in practice.

We present here a brief synopsis of the binary number system. Every realnumber, x∈R, consists of integer and fractional parts and can be uniquely
represented in a base, r, by an inﬁnite sequence,

where ai∈{0,...,r −1}. When r= 2 and we have the binary numbers D,

the commonly used decimal numbers.

Binary Arithmetic and Computer Representation
Consider a decimal number with integer and fractional parts such as 67.4
as shown in section 5.1. To translate the integer part we divide it by 2,keeping the remainders as binary digits and adding 1 as the most signiﬁcantdigit:
Remainder
67÷2=3 3 1 = >a
0= 1 (least signiﬁcant digit)
33÷2=1 6 1 = >a 1=1
16÷2=8 0 = >a 2=0
8÷2=4 0 = >a 3=0
4÷2=2 0 = >a 4=0
2÷2=0 0 = >a 5=0
a6= 1 (most signiﬁcant digit)
The decimal part is multiplied by 2:
0.2×2=0 .4= >a −1=0
0.4×2=0 .8= >a −2=0
0.8×2=1 .6= >a −3=1

7. Everyone knows that multiplying a decimal number by 10 can be done
merely by shifting the decimal one place to the right. Dividing by 10 involvesshifting the decimal one space to the left. The situation is analogous forthe binaries. Multiplying a binary number by 2 is equivalent to shifting thebinary point one digit to the right. Conversely, division by 2 shifts the binarypoint one place to the left. It is this fact that means that the tent map (6)has an exact binary digital representation for a=2 .

I. INTRODUCTION
In a series of papers including ones that are published
in prestigious physics journals, Ole Peters and his collab-
orators claim that the ‘conceptual basis of mainstream
economic theory’ is ‘ﬂawed’ and that the approach they
call ‘ergodicity economics’ gives ‘reason to hope for a fu-
ture economic science that is more parsimonious, concep-
tually clearer and less subjective’ [ 1–4]. InThe Logic of
Scientiﬁc Discovery , Popper [ 5, p. 18] suggests that fal-
siﬁability should be taken as a criterion of demarcation
between science and non-science. The Wikipedia article1
deﬁnes pseudoscience as “statements, beliefs, or practice s
that claim to be both scientiﬁc and factual but are in-
compatible with the scientiﬁc method”. The page lists
the following indicators of possible pseudoscience: (i) us e
of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims, (ii) improper
collection of evidence, (iii) lack of openness to testing by
other experts, (iv) absence of progress, (v) personaliza-
tion of issues, and (vi) use of misleading language. This
paper argues that ‘ergodicity economics’ advanced by Pe-
ters and collaborators is pseudoscience because (i) it has
so far produced few testable implications and therefore is
not falsiﬁable, and (ii) it meets many indicators of pseu-
doscience.
II. ‘ERGODICITY ECONOMICS’
Henceforth we shall refer to ‘ergodicity economics’ as
EE. It is not easy to deﬁne what EE is because I am not
an expert on this ﬁeld (I am an expert on mathemati-
cal economics,2which could be considered ‘mainstream
economic theory’). Here, to avoid unnecessary debates,
we shall focus on what is claimed in Peters [ 4], which

PhD (2013) from Yale University, I have published over 40 pee r-
reviewed research articles in economics and related ﬁelds, and I
am a tenured associate professor at an economics department
as well as a co-editor at Journal of Mathematical Economics
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-ma thematical-economics ).is published in Nature Physics and is one of the most
inﬂuential work of Peters by citation counts.3It is not
clear what kind of economic questions the author is try-
ing to address (because the problem is never deﬁned), but
based on the discussion in the section titled “A modern
treatment asking the ergodicity question”, it seems that
he is studying ﬁnancial decisions under uncertainty, as he
writes “[r]eal-life ﬁnancial decisions usually come with a
degree of uncertainty” and “[g]rowth rate optimization is
now sometimes called ‘ergodicity economics’” (p. 1218).
He also writes “the geometric mean [. . . ] is well known
among gamblers as Kelly’s criterion of 1956. Our modest
contribution is to frame these observations as a question
of ergodicity”, citing [ 6]. Based on this reading, I inter-
pret that EE prescribes “growth rate optimization”, that
is, maximizing the geometric growth rate of an invest-
ment.4
III. AN OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO PROBLEM
To contrast EE and the ‘mainstream economic theory’
(expected utility theory, henceforth EUT5) criticized in
[1–4], let us consider the following problem studied by
Merton [ 8] and Peters [ 1].
A. Model
There are two assets, risky (say a stock mutual fund)
and safe (say a money market fund). An investor chooses
a portfolio (proportion of money invested in each asset).
What is the optimal portfolio? This problem seems to
3As of the time of writing, it is cited 154 times.
4The idea of “growth rate optimization” dates back at least to [7]
and certainly before the treatment of optimal investment in a
dynamic setting based on expected utility theory [ 8,9].
5EUT was axiomatized by von Neumann and Morgenstern [ 10];
see their Section 1.3, and also [ 11, Ch. 8] for a textbook treat-
ment. Although there are diverse views among economists re-
garding the theory of decision under uncertainty, most woul d
agree that EUT is a useful benchmark. See [ 11, Part III] for
models other than EUT.",2023-06-05T21:45:49Z, juergo di city economics pseudoscience alexis air today partment economics  calornia sadie dated june iole peters  gh iole peters it logic cie nti divery  wikipedia t  pe nceforth it re peters pseudoscience iph yale  journal matmatical economics nature psics peters it  kelly our based to mortopeters mtre awhat  as t newmamorgenstersealthough  part

be fundamental for personal ﬁnance, and any theory of
investment ought to provide some prescription. To make
the problem concrete, suppose that the price Stof the
risky asset evolves according to a geometric Brownian
motion with drift µ >0and volatility σ >0, so the
instantaneous net return6is
dSt
St=µdt+σdBt, (1)
whereBtis a standard Brownian motion.7Thus,µis
the expected return. Suppose that the safe asset yields
a risk-free return 0< r < µ . Suppose that at t= 0, an
investor with wealth normalized to 1 invests a fraction
of wealth θin the risky asset and the remaining fraction
1−θin the safe asset.8Although inessential, to make
matters simple, suppose the portfolio θis chosen once
and for all and that it will be continuously rebalanced to
keep this fraction. Then the investor’s wealth at time Wt
evolves according to the geometric Brownian motion
dWt
Wt=θdSt
St+(1−θ)rdt
= (r+(µ−r)θ)dt+σθdBt. (2)
Finally, suppose the investor cares only about the termi-
nal wealth WT, whereT >0is the investment horizon.
Applying Itô’s lemma to ( 2), log wealth evolves according
to the Brownian motion
dlogWt= (r+(µ−r)θ−σ2θ2/2)dt+σθdBt.(3)
Using the well-known property of the Brownian motion,
the terminal wealth WTis lognormally distributed:
logWT∼N((r+(µ−r)θ−σ2θ2/2)T,σ2θ2T).(4)
B. Prescription of ‘ergodicity economics’
EE prescribes to maximize the long run geometric av-
erage growth rate. Because we normalized the initial
wealth to 1, the geometric average growth rate is simply
W1/T
T. Its logarithm is therefore normally distributed as
1
TlogWT∼N(r+(µ−r)θ−σ2θ2/2,σ2θ2/T).(5)
6To be clear with technical terms, if an investment is multipl ied
by 1.1, we say that the gross return is 1.1. The net return is 0. 1
or 10%. The log return is log1.1 = 0.0953.
7Some authors use WtorW(t)to denote the Brownian motion
(Wiener process) but I use the notation Bt(which is equally
common) because I will later use Wtto denote wealth. As Pe-
ters [1] rightly points out in a footnote, “[s]ome authors deﬁne
the parameters of geometric Brownian motion diﬀerently [.. . ]
notation must be carefully translated for comparisons”.
8In the two-asset case, θcan be interpreted as the leverage. I
refer toθas “portfolio” because it has the natural generalization
to multiple assets.Note that the mean of the log geometric average growth
rate (the arithmetic average log growth rate) ( 5) is con-
stant at
r+(µ−r)θ−1
2σ2θ2, (6)
and the standard deviation σθ/√
Ttends to 0 as the
investment horizon Ttends to inﬁnity. Therefore as
T→ ∞, the log geometric average growth rate converges
(in probability) to the mean ( 6). EE thus prescribes to
maximize ( 6), and because the objective function is a con-
cave quadratic function, the optimal portfolio is clearly
θ=µ−r
σ2. This solution was given by Peters [ 1, Equation
(23)], though this type of reasoning goes back at least to
Latané [ 7].
C. Prescription of ‘mainstream economic theory’
In contrast, the ‘mainstream economic theory’
approach—expected utility theory (EUT)—prescribes
that the investor maximizes the expected utility
E[u(WT)],9whereuis called a von Neumann-
Morgenstern utility function. The most commonly used
utility function is the constant relative risk aversion
(CRRA) utility function u(x) =x1−γ
1−γ, where0< γ/negationslash= 1is
called the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient [ 12]. The case
γ= 1corresponds to log utility u(x) = logx. Using the
property of the moment generating function of the nor-
mal distribution, for γ/negationslash= 1a straightforward calculation
yields
U(θ) =E[u(WT)]
=1
1−γexp/parenleftbigg/parenleftbigg
(1−γ)/parenleftbigg
r+(µ−r)θ−1
2σ2θ2/parenrightbigg
+1
2(1−γ)2σ2θ2/parenrightbigg
T/parenrightbigg
.
A monotonic transformation yields
V(θ) =1
T(1−γ)log((1−γ)U(θ))
=r+(µ−r)θ−1
2γσ2θ2. (7)
Ifγ= 1, a similar calculation yields the identical ob-
jective function ( 7). Since V(θ)is a concave quadratic
function of θ, the maximum is achieved when θ=µ−r
γσ2.
This solution was given by Merton [ 8, Equation (25)].10
9This statement is an oversimpliﬁcation of EUT. Economists h ave
studied many other generalizations, for instance allowing for
consumption in intermediate periods, non-independent and non-
Gaussian returns, and portfolio adjustment over time.
10The notation is slightly diﬀerent. Our µ,γcorrespond to Merton

IV. IS ‘ERGODICITY ECONOMICS’
TESTABLE?
Obviously, the objective functions of EE ( 6) and EUT
(7) agree (for this particular optimal portfolio problem)
whenγ= 1, so both theories make identical predictions
in that particular case. Some economists have criticized
the ‘growth optimal’ approach (maximizing the long run
geometric average) because it is consistent with expected
utility maximization only in the special case of logarith-
mic utility [ 13,14].11That critique is valid conditional on
accepting expected utility theory , but is obviously uncon-
vincing to those who rejects EUT in the ﬁrst place. Oth-
ers have criticized EE for misunderstanding EUT [ 15,16].
Here I criticize EE from a diﬀerent point of view. If
EE is a science, according to Popper [ 5] it must pro-
vide testable implications: the theory must be falsiﬁable.
The optimal portfolio problem described above is one
testable implication: in principle, we can gather data on
the model parameters µ,r,σ and check whether investors
choose the portfolio θ=µ−r
σ2prescribed by ‘growth rate
optimization’ of EE. Similarly, EUT is testable by per-
haps conducting experiments in which we vary the model
parameters µ,r,σ2and check whether the chosen port-
folio is proportional toµ−r
σ2(only proportional, because
the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient is not directly ob-
servable).
What if we consider a diﬀerent problem? Suppose an
investor lives for three periods denoted by t= 0,1,2,
which could be interpreted as the young age, middle age,
and retirement. The (non-ﬁnancial) income of the in-
vestor at time tis denoted by Yt(which could be a ran-
dom variable). There could be two (risky and riskless) as-
sets as before; the gross return of the risky asset between
timet−1andtis denoted by Rt, and the gross risk-free
rate isRf. The investor could also choose consumption
Ct. Then the problem is to choose the consumption-
investment plan (Ct,θt)satisfying the dynamic budget
constraints
Wt+1= (Rf+(Rt+1−Rf)θt)(Wt−Ct+Yt)
fort= 0,1givenW0= 0. EUT (or I should just say
‘economic theory’ because it does not need to be ex-
pected utility theory) has a prescription for this optimal
11Interestingly, Peters [ 1] cites Merton and Samuelson [ 14] out of
context in a sentence discussing the “advantage of [maximiz ed
time-average growth rate]” (p. 1601). In fact, [ 14] is quite crit-
ical to “growth rate optimization”, writing (p. 69) “Recour se to
the Law of Large Numbers, as applied to repeated multiplica-
tive variates (cumulative sums of logarithms of portfolio v alue
relatives), has independently tempted various writers, ho lding
out to them the hope that one can replace an arbitrary util-
ity function of terminal wealth with all its intractability , by the
function U(WT) = logWT: maximizing the geometric mean or
the expected log of outcomes, it was hoped, would provide an
asymptotically exact criterion for rational action”.consumption-portfolio problem. Any ﬁrst year PhD stu-
dent in economics will be able to formulate the problem
mathematically. Given the assumption (or data) on the
utility function, income process, and the return process, a
suﬃciently competent PhD student will be able to solve
the model numerically and compare the model predic-
tions to the data. If the 3-period problem is unrealistic,
no problem; it could be 30 period or inﬁnite horizon or
whatever. My point is that given the assumptions we
make, economic theory will provide a testable implica-
tion that is in principle falsiﬁable, and therefore it is a
science.
I wonder what EE (growth rate optimization) has to
say about this simple model of consumption and invest-
ment. Peters and Gell-Mann [ 3] note that “[a] generaliza-
tion beyond purely additive or multiplicative dynamics is
possible, just as it is possible to deﬁne utility functions
other than the linear or logarithmic function. This will be
the subject of a future publication”. I am looking forward
to seeing how EE would solve the above consumption-
investment problem, though I am not optimistic as it
has been 12 years since [ 1] was published and we have not
seen much progress (and the result in [ 1] is itself a minor
reformulation of [ 6,7]). Until EE provides testable im-
plications, we should stay away from it as pseudoscience.
V. INDICATORS OF PSEUDOSCIENCE
Let us return to Wikipedia’s indicators of pseudo-
science discussed in the introduction. Many of them ap-
ply to EE.
(i)Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims Pe-
ters and Gell-Mann [ 3] make the grandiose claim “[t]he
concepts we have presented resolve the fundamental
problem of decision theory, therefore game theory, and
asset pricing” without presenting any concrete applica-
tion or potentially testable implication.
(ii)Improper collection of evidence The only experi-
mental evidence Peters [ 4] cites is Meder et al.[17], which
has also been criticized [ 15]. Peters [ 1] cites Merton and
Samuelson [ 14] out of context. Peters [ 1] states “[i]n
economics, a mistaken belief in ergodicity has produced
widespread conceptual inconsistency” citing the review
article [ 18], though nowhere in that article such a state-
ment can be found.
(iii)Lack of openness to testing by other experts As
of the time of writing, Peters lists 34 research papers
listed on his webpage.12Among them, 22 are published
and 12 are unpublished working papers. Among the 22
published papers, only three are published in journals
remotely related to economics (one in Decision Analy-
sis, one in Quantitative Finance , and one in Journal of
Income Distribution ). Thus, despite the label ‘ergodic
economics’, it is not reviewed by experts in economics.

subjective' (Peters, 2019). This paper argues that 'ergodicity economics' is

(iv)Absence of progress Peters often cites only very
old works such as Huygens, Bernoulli, Kelly [ 6], and
Samuelson [ 9]. EE does not seem to add anything new
beyond [ 6].
(v)Personalization of issues Peters and Gell-Mann
[3] criticize with unnecessarily strong language: “Menger
did decision theory a crucial disservice by undoing
Laplace’s correction, adding further errors, and writing
a persuasive but invalid paper on the subject that con-
cluded incorrectly”.
(vi)Use of misleading language The abstract of Pe-
ters [4] states “Economics typically deals with systems far
from equilibrium—speciﬁcally with models of growth. It
may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the pre-
vailing formulations of economic theory—expected util-
ity theory and its descendants—make an indiscriminate
assumption of ergodicity”. Here it is unclear what is
meant by “equilibrium” (there are many general equilib-
rium models of growth in economics) and what “indis-
criminate assumption of ergodicity” refers to.VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Physicists and economists have a long history of inter-
action. Walras and Pareto, who have made fundamental
contributions to economics, were also trained in physics
and engineering. The ﬁrst Yale economics PhD, Irving
Fisher (1891), was a student of the physicist Willard
Gibbs. More recently, since the late 1990s, there was
a fruitful interaction between physicists and economists
for studying the power law behavior [ 19–22]. I myself
have modest contributions published in physics journals
[23,24] and acknowledge physicists’ contributions to eco-
nomics [ 25].
I appreciate the open-mindedness of physicists and wel-
come their perspectives on economic phenomena. How-
ever, I must express my concerns about a few researchers
who lack proper training in the subject matter and at-
tack economics based on ignorance and misunderstand-
ing. Even more concerning is that some of them, like
Peters, have used popular and social media to dissemi-
nate pseudoscientiﬁc information [ 26–29]. We should all
follow scientiﬁc methods, and I hope that scientiﬁc jour-
nals can maintain the integrity of peer review.

Abstract
This paper constructs a global economic policy uncertainty index through the principal component analysis of the
economic policy uncertainty indices for twenty primary eco nomies around the world. We ﬁnd that the PCA-based
global economic policy uncertainty index is a good proxy for the economic policy uncertainty on a global scale, which
is quite consistent with the GDP-weighted global economic p olicy uncertainty index. The PCA-based economic policy
uncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and correlation of the global ﬁnancial market,
which indicates that the stocks are more volatile and correl ated when the global economic policy uncertainty is higher.
The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index per forms slightly better because the relationship between
the PCA-based uncertainty and market volatility and correl ation is more signiﬁcant.

1. Introduction
The study on uncertainty has attracted much atten-
tion ( Bloom ,2009 ).P´ astor and Veronesi (2012 ) and
P´ astor and Veronesi (2013 ) develop a general equilib-
rium model to study how changes in government policy
choice affect stock prices and explore the relationship
between political uncertainty and stock risk premium.
Baker et al. (2016 ) construct an index as the proxy for
economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the United States
and 11 other major economies, which was initially put
forward by Baker et al. (2013 ). Many scholars, such
asMoore (2017 ) and Arbatli et al. (2017 ), construct
other indices for different economies successively us-
ing the same method. Bontempi et al. (2016 ) introduce
a new uncertainty indicator based on Internet searches.
Castelnuovo and Tran (2017 ) develop uncertainty in-
dices for the United States and Australia, which are
based on Google Trends data.
Many papers have studied the inﬂuence of eco-
nomic policy uncertainty on the international ﬁnan-

pacts of economic policy uncertainty shocks on stock-
bond correlations for the ﬁnancial market in United
States. Kl¨ oßner and Sekkel (2014 ) discuss international
spillovers of policy uncertainty using the EPU indices
from six developed economies. Brogaard and Detzel
(2015 ) use a search-based measure to capture economic
policy uncertainty for 21 economies, and found eco-
nomic policy uncertainty has a signiﬁcant effect on the
contemporaneous market returns and volatility.
Recently, the aggregate global economic policy un-
certainty (GEPU) has been proposed and investigated.
Davis (2016 ) constructs an index of global economic
policy uncertainty which is a GDP-weighted average
of national EPU indices for 20 economies. Fang et al.
(2018 ) examine whether the GDP-based GEPU in-
dex provides predictability for the gold futures market
volatility. Ersan et al. (2019 ) access the effect of the
GDP-based GEPU index on the stock returns of travel
and leisure companies.
For a ﬁnancial market with multiple assets, the largest
eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of returns, when
normalized by the number of assets, quantiﬁes the sys-
temic risk of the market, while its eigenvector reﬂects
the whole movement of the market ( Billio et al. ,2012 ;

In order to calculate the PCA-based GEPU
index, we retrieve the economic policy un-
certainty indices for twenty economies from
http://www.policyuncertainty.com .
These twenty economies are Australia (AU), Brazil
(BR), Canada (CA), Chile (CL), China (CN), France
(FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), India (IN), Ire-
land (IE), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Mexico (MX), the
Netherlands (NL), Russia (RU), South Korea (KR),
Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), the United Kingdom (UK),
and the United States (US), which are in perfect
accordance with the economies that Davis (2016 ) apply
to construct the GDP-based GEPU index. Fig. 1shows
the evolution of these EPU indices from January 2003
to December 2018, where each index includes 192
monthly observations.

In terms of the global ﬁnancial market, we selectMSCI’s All Country World Index (ACWI) as its mea-
sure. The MSCI ACWI represents the performance of
the stocks across 23 developed and 24 emerging mar-
kets. Fig. 2displays the trend of MSCI ACWI, which
covers the daily closing prices from December 2002 to
December 2018. The composite indices for each mar-
ket (from Bloomberg) are utilized to evaluate the cor-
relations between markets also using the daily closing
prices from December 2002 to December 2018.

3. Methodology
First, we normalize the EPU index ifor each econ-
omy over a moving window [ t−T+1,t] of size T:
xi(s)≡(EPU i(s)−/an}bracketle{tEPU i(s)/an}bracketri}hts)/σi, (1)
where EPU i(s) represents the index for the ith economy
in the s-th month andσiis the standard deviation of
EPU is. Second, we obtain the cross-correlation matrix
Cby computing the pairwise cross-correlation coefﬁ-
cient between any two EPU indices for the economies:
Ci j≡/angbracketleftBig
xi(s)xj(s)/angbracketrightBig
. (2)
By deﬁnition, the elements Ci jvary from−1 to 1,
where Ci j=1 corresponds to a perfect positive cross-
correlation, Ci j=1 corresponds to a perfect anti-
correlation, and Ci j=0 reﬂects no cross-correlations
between the indices for economy iand economy j. The
cross-correlation matrix can also be expressed in the
matrix form:
C=1
TXX′, (3)
where Xis an N×Tmatrix with elements {xi(s) :i=
1,..., N;s=1,..., T}andX′denotes the transpose of
X. Third, we obtain the eigenvector u1(t) for the largest
eigenvalueλ1(t) of the cross-correlation matrix in the
t-th window:
Cu1(t)=λ1(t)u1(t), (4)

4. Empirical results
In order to examine the robustness of the results, we
construct the PCA-based GEPU index for ﬁve window
sizes T=24,30,36,42, and 48 months. Fig. 3displays
the comparison between the GEPU-PCA and GEPU-
GDP indices for T=24 months. We ﬁnd that the
evolutionary trajectories of the GEPU-GDP and GEPU-
PCA indices are close to each other, which is also indi-
cated by the nice linearity of the data points in the cor-
responding scatter plot. The results for other window
sizes are very similar. Overall, all the GEPU-PCA in-
dices are very close to the GEPU-GDP indices, although
GEPU-PCA is obtained without using any other eco-
nomic data. The discrepancy between the two indices
increases when the uncertainty is high.

For the sake of a comparative analysis, we adopt the
same empirical models as P´ astor and Veronesi (2013 ).
For volatility, we employ the following regressions:
Vol(t)=β0+β1GEPU (t)+ε(t) (6)
Vol(t)=β0+β1GEPU (t)+β2Vol(t−1)+ε(t),(7)
where Volrepresents the volatility. For correlation, the
following regressions are considered:
Corr (t)=β0+β1GEPU (t)+ε(t) (8)
Corr (t)=β0+β1GEPU (t)+β2Corr (t−1)+ε(t),(9)
where Corr stands for the correlation. The lagged
terms, Vol(t−1)andCorr (t−1), eliminate most of the
autocorrelation in the dependent variable series.

β1>0 in all twenty regressions and all the 20 point
estimates are signiﬁcant at the 10% level, which pro-
vides strong evidence for the theoretical foundation that
the global market should be more volatile when there is
higher economic policy uncertainty. Panel B presents
weaker supporting evidence for the associated theoreti-
cal foundation since only three point estimates of β1are
at the 10% level although β1is positive in 17 of the 20
regressions.
We also ﬁnd that after removing the autocorrelation
in the volatility and correlation, the coefﬁcient β1de-
creases. In addition, in most cases, β1increases with in-
creasing sample length, except for GEPU-GDP versus
volatility using Eq. ( 9) in whichβ1is independent of
the sample length. Indeed, we argue that this trending
phenomenon is caused by the fact that the correlation is
stronger between market volatility (or correlation) and
uncertainty in early years, as shown in Fig. 4.
5. Conclusions
This paper constructs a novel index of global eco-
nomic policy uncertainty based on the principal com-
ponent analysis. This index is shown to be quite close
to the GDP-weighted average global economic policy
uncertainty index. We employ both GEPU-PCA and
GEPU-GDP as the proxies for uncertainty to investi-
gate the association between the global ﬁnancial market
and economic policy uncertainty and ﬁnd that the global
market should be more volatile and correlated when
there is higher economic policy uncertainty. Moreover,
GEPU-PCA performs lightly better than GEPU-GDP
when the observations are enough in the sense that the
correlations are more signiﬁcant when GEPU-PCA is
adopted in the analysis.

ABSTRACT
Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic growth theories
identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the relative importance of the deter-
minants remains unknown, and additional variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions
of the interactions. The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate
measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and structural view of the pro-
ductive possibilities of countries, i.e.their capabilities. Dierent endowments of capabilities are crucial
ingredients in explaining dierences in economic performances. In this paper we employ economic t-
ness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex network techniques. Focusing on
the combined roles of tness and some more traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between
economic growth theories and the economic complexity literature. Our ndings, in agreement with
other recent empirical studies, show that tness plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and,
when it is included in the analysis, can be either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can
completely overshadow them.

1. INTRODUCTION
Why are some countries wealthier than others? And why do some countries exhibit sustained rates of
growth over long periods, whereas others appear to be stuck in a low-income, low-growth path? These
questions have been central to economics ever since its origin as a science, following Adam Smiths [1]
original enquiry. An understanding of the main determinants of long-run growth arguably remains the
most important issue in economics.
The ultimate causes of economic growth are however still not fully understood. In an inuential
study, Helpman [2] examines the recent literature on the subject and acknowledges that the determi-
nants of economic growth remain a mystery. Early models based on capital deepening and exogenous
technical progress have given way to contributions that emphasise the endogenous nature of economic
growth, and that explore the role of factors such as expenditure on education, investment in research
and development, openness to international trade, and the presence of institutions that foster social
and economic inclusion [3].
Whilst all of these factors play a role in aecting economic growth, the relative importance of
each of them is more dicult to establish, especially because they are bound to interact with eacharXiv:1808.10428v1  [econ.GN]  30 Aug 2018",2018-08-30T17:47:28Z,t aelic bar lla manuel pug li zac aria pasquale scar am oz ipartment economics nance  studi roma tor very at rome  institute lex tems rome  acoisssevla sp articial intellence schonance management  londolondovelopment mort di ifocusi our keywords economic tness lexity capabitieconomic groh w and tse adam smiths at ilp ma whst  aug

The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate

explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ

","other in complex ways. Furthermore, this list of key determinants of economic growth may not be
exhaustive: additional factors which have hitherto been ignored may be just as important, and may
contribute signicant predictive power to the models that have been studied so far. Exogenous as
well as endogenous growth theories predict that growth can be explained by a set of variables which
capture both the initial conditions of the economy and the rate at which its production inputs are
accumulated. The extent to which these models can predict the growth performance of broad cross-
sections of countries or regions is however limited [4,5]. It is therefore important to look for additional
drivers of growth, which may have been overlooked in the more traditional analyses.
The present paper explores one such additional factor: the tness of the economy, as measured by a
complex-network metric based on the countries revealed comparative advantage [6]. The prole of trade
specialization of a country can in fact be regarded as a reection of its underlying capabilities, which
can be dened as the skills that enable its economy to expand into new production requirements and
to adopt new technologies [7]. Conventional measures of the production possibilities of an economy do
not explicitly consider its degree of exibility and adaptability: if more complex economies are however
also endowed with a richer set of capabilities, then ignoring them would lead to a misspecication of
the underlying models, because relevant explanatory variables would be omitted from the analysis.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the role of capabilities and complexity
for economic growth. Section 3 denes the measure of Fitness used in the paper and explains the em-
pirical methodology and the data. Section 4 presents the empirical evidence from both non-parametric
graphical analysis and econometric estimation. Section 5 concludes.
2. ECONOMIC GROWTH, CAPABILITIES AND COMPLEXITY
In his encyclopaedic treatment of modern theories of economic growth, Acemoglu [5] oers a thorough
overview of the main approaches that have been set out to explain the dynamic growth paths of the
economies in the long run. The early analysis by Solow [8] identied the main sources of growth
in the accumulation of physical capital and in exogenous technical progress, which is responsible for
the upward shift of the production possibility frontier of the economy over time. In the presence of
decreasing returns to capital in the aggregate production function, Solows model predicts that the
rate of growth will eventually tend to peter out, as the economy approaches its long-run steady-state
dynamic equilibrium path.
An important implication of the exogenous growth model is that the income per capita of low-
income economies should tend to converge to that of high-income ones in the long run, and we should
therefore observe a catching-up of less developed economies to the more developed ones. Empirical
analyses show that there is some evidence of convergence of low income to high income economies,
albeit at a very slow pace [4].
More recent analyses of growth have sought to endogenize the rate of technical progress as the
outcome of explicit decisions made by economic agents. These models overcome the assumption of
decreasing returns with respect to the factor that is accumulated by acknowledging to the existence
of externalities among rms. This view was rst explored by Arrow [9], and is captured in his notion
of learning-by-doing. New technologies are incorporated in new investments, and therefore the rate at
which aggregate productivity increases is directly related to the rate of new investment in the economy.
As a result, the productivity of individual rms is an increasing function of the aggregate capital
stock in the economy. This way, it is possible to have constant or even increasing returns to capital
accumulation at the aggregate level, even if the technology at the rm level still exhibits conventional
decreasing returns to its own production inputs.",2018-08-30T17:47:28Z,furtr endogenous t it t t conventnal t sesetness seseicem og lu t solo isolo aemical  tse  arrow new as

growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the
relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional
variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.
The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate
measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and
structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more
traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth
theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement
with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in
fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be
either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely
overshadow them.
","Later developments in endogenous growth theories identify the main drivers of long-run growth
in investment in education in the presence of externalities from human capital accumulation [10], in
expenditure in Research and Development in a stochastic Schumpeterian model of creative destruction
[11], or in the openness of economy to international trade through learning-by-exporting [12,13]. These
drivers may interact with each other, as in the model by Lucas [14] where a high level of human capital
in the economy facilitates investment in new technologies, and in turn enhances their growth-improving
eects. The recent literature on growth has also explored the role of social and political institutions.
In particular, Acemoglu and Robinson [15] distinguish between inclusive institutions, which stimulate
entrepreneurship and innovations, and extractive institutions, which are instead responsible for creating
incentives to exploit rents and which have a dampening eect on growth.
Endogenous growth theories are able to explain the lack of convergence of poorer countries and
regions to the richer ones: since the returns to the factors which are accumulated are now constant or
even increasing, the rate of growth of the economy is not necessarily predicted to slow down along its
long-run equilibrium path. An important extension of growth models further considers the possibility
of multiple steady state equilibria. Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny [16] formalise the notion of a big
push, according to which a discrete development eort is required for a low-income economy to escape
its poverty trap and to set in motion a process of self-sustaining growth. The rationale for multiple
equilibria rests on the assumptions of increasing returns in the scale of production and of non-pecuniary
externalities among sectors. Multiple equilibria can provide a justication for targeted development
policies, for instance in the form of government support to industrialisation in a critical mass of in-
dustrial sectors. Models with multiple steady-state equilibria have been generalised to models with
multiple dynamic steady states (e.g. Krugman, [17], and Matsuyama, [18]) where initial conditions can
be critical to determine the long-run growth path of the economy.
A novel approach to the analysis of economic growth, however, goes beyond aggregate measures
of the production inputs and considers instead a more granular and structural view of the production
possibilities of the economy. This approach examines the possible role of capabilities, which could
be dened as a broad set of skills that could adapt to changing production requirements and which
facilitate the introduction of new technologies. This approach can be traced back to the seminal work
by Hirschman [19], where capabilities make it possible to create backward and forward linkages across
economic sectors, and Penrose [20] with her resource-based theory of the rm. Teece et al. [21] argue
that capabilities in an organization are both intangible and non-transferable, and lay the foundations
for the modern complex network analysis by showing that they constitute the key factors for a coherent
growth of the rm consistent with its core competencies. Abramovitz [22] referred to social capabilities
as all those attributes that aect a countrys ability to operate modern and large-scale businesses, and
which include their political and social characteristics: they should therefore not be interpreted in a
narrow individualistic sense (see also Fagerberg and Srholec, [23]). Capabilities can aect economic
growth directly through their impact on the adoption of innovations, as shown by Lall [24] and by
Kremer [25].
In a series of important contributions, Sutton [26, 27], Sutton and Treer, [28]) argues that the
source of the main dierences in output per capita across economies lies not in their accumulation
of physical factors of production, as in the conventional theories of growth, but rather in the set of
capabilities with which their economy is endowed. These capabilities enable rms to take advantage of
investment by increasing their labour productivity and also make it possible to further expand their set
of skills, thereby generating a virtuous circle. Suttons analysis combines insights from the Industrial
Organization literature, the Economic Geography literature, and the Trade literature.

capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ

","results is that, in equilibrium, the market structure of an industry will tend to encompass a variety of
products of dierent quality. The capabilities required to produce high-quality products will always
be scarce. This implies that, on a global scale, in each industry there will only be a limited number of
rms which hold a dominant position. From Economic Geography, capabilities must be concentrated in
some countries in order to take full advantage of agglomeration economies. Each countrys comparative
advantage will therefore reect what Sutton calls the \\\\economics of quality"". The available capabilities
become a key factor in global trade specialization and in determining the growth prospects of each
country.
Capabilities are however unobservable. Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik [29] argue that they can
be inferred from a countrys export specialization prole. Production of complex goods involves the
joint execution of a large number of highly specialised tasks [25, 30]. This requires both the existence
of broad sets of advanced skills, and the ability to combine them eectively. A detailed examination
of the revealed comparative advantage across all countries in the world using the tools of complex
network analysis can identify those countries which specialise in complex products. Their production
could involve a number of tasks by high-skilled workers, who could not be substituted by low-skill
workers without compromising the quality of the nished product [25]. The sophisticated production
structure of these countries also allows them more easily to introduce innovations and to adopt advanced
technologies consistent with the role of dynamic capabilities in an environment of rapid technological
change analyzed by Teece et. al. [7]. The location of a country in the global product space would
therefore be a signicant predictor of its growth potential.
The usefulness of measures of product complexity for predicting growth has been demonstrated
by Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik [29], who show that the mix of good that a country produces
can explain its growth rate. Ferrarini and Scaramozzino [31] conrm that production complexity can
help explain dierences in economic performance, in an endogenous growth model with human capital
accumulation. Pugliese et al. [32] analyze the role of tness during the process of development and
industrialization showing that tness crucially eases the passage towards sustained growth. Sbardella
et al. [33] empirically demonstrate that tness is a key variable in explaining the relationship between
wage inequality and economic development. Boltho et al. [34] argue that the more complex production
structure in East Germany relative to that in the Italian Mezzogiorno can contribute to explain the
unsatisfactory performance of the latter, and its lack of convergence to the more prosperous regions in
the Centre-North of the country.
Cristelli et al. [35] develop an innovative approach to predict economic growth, the Selective
Predictability Scheme (SPS), which makes use of ideas from the theory of economic complexity and
which adopts the the tness metric [6, 36, 37]. SPS is shown to out-perform a number of alternative
forecasting models, thus conrming the key role played by the complexity of the structure of production
for predicting the future economic performance of a country. Tacchella et al. [38] further develop this
approach to growth forecasting and outperform the accuracy of the IMF ve-year forecasts by more
than 25% .
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1 Measuring Fitness
As mentioned above, in this paper we use the tness [6, 36, 37], a measure of economic complexity
based on cross-country dierences in productive structures. Fitness is a proxy for capabilities, and is
calculated by applying complex network techniques to the analysis of international trade data.

fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be

","GDP may not be sucient to describe development and growth processes, as two countries with similar
GDP levels may actually possess profoundly dierent endowments of capabilities. Countries that are
below the income expected from their economic performances may have already developed the full
range of products that is within their technological reach, nevertheless this capability level may have
not been yet translated into higher GDP levels. Thus, as explained in Section 2, dierent endowments
of capabilities are the main, albeit not empirically observable, sources in explaining dierent economic
performances and in shaping the export proles of countries.
In network theory, the notion of capabilities can be conceptually described as an intermediate net-
work layer that connects countries to their exported products [36, 37]. As schematically illustrated in
Figure 1, we can dene a tripartite network whose three classes of nodes are countries ( C), capabilities
(K) and products (P). The allowed links, connecting the Knodes to theCorPnodes, describe the
capability owned by a country and the capability required to export a product with a comparative ad-
vantage. Tacchella et al. [36] explore the functioning of this tripartite network and show the high degree
of correlation between a country's endowment of capabilities and its tness. However, the capability
layer, despite being conceptually crucial, is intangible and the tripartite network is a purely theoretical
tool to better visualize our theoretical framework. By using international trade data, the information
coded in the hidden capability layer can be gathered by building an empirical bipartite network in
which countries are connected to the products they export [39] with a revealed comparative advantage
(RCA) [40]. As represented in Figure 1, this country-product network is viewed as a contraction of the
tripartite network over the capability dimension. How to extract in an optimal way the informative
Figure 1: In our theoretical framework capabilities are crucial in explaining the economic performances of
countries. As can be observed on the left, conceptually we can visualize capabilities as an intermediate level in
a tripartite country-capability-product network. Nevertheless, this is a theoretical model, capabilities in fact are
non-measurable entities. Information on capabilities can be gathered by building an empirical country-product
network through international trade data. As can be seen on the left, such bipartite network can be interpreted
as the projection of the tripartite network. In the country-product network a country-product link is established
if and only if the country has a revealed comparative advantage in exporting that product. [36,37].

","To understand the rationale beyond the metric it is useful to observe the binary adjacency matrix of
the network, ^M, whose rows represent countries and columns their exported products (see Fig.3.1).
RCA is used to lter and digitize the data allowing to focus on qualitative dierences, rather than
quantitative, in the export baskets of countries: which kinds of products are exported competitively,
not in which volumes. Therefore, matrix entries are set equal to 1 when a country exports a product
withRCA1, and 0 in the opposite case:
Mcp=(
1 ifRCA cp1
0 ifRCA cp<1.(1)
Figure 2: The binary matrix of countries and products built from the worldwide 1998's export ows of BACI
data-set [41].The rows and columns of the matrix are ranked according to the tness-Complexity algorithm. The
rows are sorted by increasing country tness and the columns by increasing product Complexity. In such a way,
the matrix acquires a triangular-like shape: countries with more diversied export baskets are more competitive,
while countries specialized in few products {which generally are also exported by every other country{ are the
less competitive. Source of the gure: [36].
If suitably ordered, the matrix assumes a quasi-triangular shape. Indeed, by looking at the matrix
triangularity, it is possible to infer that, on the one hand, a largely diversied country's ability to export
a product with a comparative advantage gives no clues on its complexity. On the other hand, when a
poorly diversied country {which has a comparative advantage in exporting few and very ubiquitous
products{ is able to export a product with a comparative advantage it is likely that its production
requires a low level of industrial sophistication. This is quite informative: a product is complex if
low-tness countries do not export it. To make this clearer, consider a straightforward example of a
high complexity product, transistors, and a low complexity product, nails. Only highly industrially and
technologically developed countries are able to export transistors; by contrast, nails are exported by
all sorts of countries, both more and less industrialized. Consequently, the low complexity of nails can
be surmised directly from their presence in the export basket of low tness countries. This observation
hints at a non-linearity in the relation between product Complexity and country tness1. Therefore,
from the matrix ^M, it is possible to obtain an intensive metric that measures country tness ( Fc) as
a weighted average of the country export basket's diversication, where the weight is the complexity

","economy is going through: in each phase the dimensions of interest combine in an a priori unknown
fashion.
To provide a basis for comparability with the more traditional analysis on growth determinants, we
oer an additional tool of interpretation and perform a linear parametric regression model. In the latter
various drivers of economic growth gure as right-hand-side explanatory variables aecting the growth
rate of GDP per capita, which is on the left-hand side of the equation. The idea is to add tness to
the growth drivers and observe whether and to what extent the results change. As discussed above, a
non-parametric approach is the most appropriate framework to investigate the complex and non-linear
interactions that are at the basis of the process of growth and development. Indeed, a linear parametric
approach, looking at averaged interactions and having strong assumptions on the functional forms of
the relationships, might not recognize the importance of a strong but non-linear signal. Specically,
for instance, a discrete element as the presence or absence of an enabling capability necessary to
competitively export a product can change in unpredictable ways the development prole of a country.
These nuances might remain unobserved when using a linear parametric approach. Nevertheless, since
non-parametric analyses can be performed only by looking at the simultaneous eect of tness and a
single growth driver on GDP growth rate, a linear regression enables us to test the robustness of our
results by observing cross-media eects.
Our empirical evidence is obtained by using an unbalanced panel of countries over the time period
1963{2000, the number of countries slightly varying around 144. In order to avoid cyclical short-run
uctuations, the GDP per capita growth rate is calculated over a  t= 5 years. Furthermore, to reduce
the risk of simultaneity bias, a lag of ve years is considered between the explanatory variables and
GDP per capita growth rate.
In practice, in our non-parametric analysis, we explore the empirical relations by looking at tridi-
mensional color-maps, smoothed representations of GDP per capita growth rate for dierent values of
tness on the x-axis and, on the y-axis, of each one of Capital Intensity, Capital-Output Ratio, GDP
per capita, Life Expectancy, Secondary Schooling, and Total Factor Productivity. The color-maps are
realized trough a multivariate Nadaraya-Watson regression [47], a continuous non-parametric kernel
estimator and by pooling all countries and years in the panel.
We then perform a more traditional parametric linear regression analysis. We opt for a xed eect
analysis with robust standard errors. Our explanatory variables are the one listed above, while on the
left hand side of the equation gures GDP per capita growth rate.
3.3 Sources of data
The levels of GDP, Population, Total Factor Productivity, Capital, and Human Capital are taken from
the Penn World Table 9.0 (PWT) produced by the University of Groningen and the University of
Pennsylvania [48].
We also include in our analysis the Life Expectancy measure of the World Development Indicators,
the collection of development statistics of the World Bank [49].
Finally, tness is taken from the Export tness data-set developed by the PIL group of the Institute
of Complex Systems in Rome which covers a number of countries varying between 130 and 151, over
the period 1963{2000. As briey explained in the previous section and shown in detail in Tacchella et
al.[6], Cristelli et al. [37], tness is obtained trough an empirical algorithm that, for the chosen time
window, employs international trade data from UN-COMTRADE [50]. The choice of the time period
of our analysis was constrained by the availability of tness data.",2018-08-30T17:47:28Z,to it as ined spec tse nevertless our ifurtr icapital intensity capital output rat le eeancy secondary schooli total faor produivity t nad area    our sour populattotal faor produivity capital humacapital penworld table  renie pennsylvania  le eeancy world velopment indicators world bank nally eort institute lex tems rome as tac sll is tell t

","4. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
4.1 Non-parametric Graphical Analysis
Fitness and GDP per capita
As follows from the hypothesis of diminishing returns with respect to the factor which is being accumu-
lated, exogenous growth theories predict higher growth in response to lower starting GDP per capita,
since in the long-run all economies should catch-up and converge to similar income levels. Initial GDP
per capita, thus, should have a negative impact on economic growth. Such conditional convergence has
been reported, even if not to the extent predicted by neoclassical models , by Barro [51] and Mankiw
et. al [45]. However, other important empirical contributions do not nd evidence of conditional
convergence [52,53].
Our empirical nding show that tness is decisive in determining the growth prole of countries
[32, 35, 46]. Looking at the variability of color, in Figure 3 we can distinguish three areas. First, in
the case of countries with low starting tness ( ",2018-08-30T17:47:28Z,nographical analysis tness as initial subarr mania our looki  rst

","Figure 3: The color-map represents the tridimensional relation between tness, GDP per capita and subsequent
GDP per capita growth rate, where a  t= 5 years is considered. The variation of the growth rate is represented
through color. The color-map is obtained through a non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimation. Countries
with low tness are not able to achieve subsequent high growth rates, irrespective of their initial GDP per capita
level. For countries with intermediate initial tness, higher starting GDP per capita results in mildly higher
subsequent growth rates. Finally, countries with high initial tness are able to grow at very high rates, especially
when their starting GDP per capita is low or intermediate. As has been explored in detail [32, 35, 46], tness,
when put into relation with GDP per capita, is able to suggest future scheme of development not fully captured
by solely monetary metrics.

low/intermediate starting capital intensity are able to achieve the fastest growth rate.
Fitness and Employment Rate
The employment rate is dened as the employment-to-population ratio, where employment levels are

As mentioned in the Introduction, according to endogenous growth models, the employment rate
should have a positive eect on economic growth. In particular, Arrow's learning-by-doing model [9]
predicts that higher employment rates create positive externalities due to a larger size of the market.
In Figure 5, the movement of color hints at the presence of non-linear dependencies, and dierent
behaviors of GDP per capita growth rate can be identied. The positive eect of the employment rate
on economic growth is detected only for the highest levels of employment rate, after a critical threshold

","Figure 4: The color-map represents the tridimensional relation between tness, capital intensity and subsequent
GDP per capita growth rate, where a  t= 5 years is considered. The variation of the growth rate is represented
through color. The color-map is obtained through a non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimation. When the
combined eect of tness and capital intensity is taken into consideration, the latter looses explanatory power
and the growth prole of countries is almost completely explained by their tness level. Higher tness leads to
higher growth rates, however, countries with high tness and intermediate capital intensity are able to achieve
the highest growth rates.
Fitness and Life Expectancy
Life expectancy is a proxy for healthcare quality. The eect of life expectancy on economic outcomes
is positive and signicant according to the growth regressions by Barro [4, 44]: better health should
lead to higher economic growth.
In Figure 6 such positive eect is only obtained when a critical threshold of circa 73 years is
exceeded. Similarly to Figure 5, also here a non-linear behavior is found, and tness almost entirely
dominates the dynamics. Except for life expectancy &73 years, low tness countries grow slowly,
whilst the contrary is true for high tness countries. Nevertheless, for high tness countries too growth
rates are higher if life expectancy is approximately higher than 60 years. Such threshold falls for very
high tness countries: lower life expectancy is oset by increasing capabilities.
However, when it comes to demographic variables, setting the direction of the arrow of causality
may poses some problems. Life expectancy is listed among the growth determinants, but also the
opposite relation is likely, it could be the case that high growth rates lift up life expectancy rather than
the opposite.",2018-08-30T17:47:28Z, t t t nad area  whr tness le eeancy le t barr i simarly  except nevertless sule

through color. The color-map is obtained through a non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimation. Only the
highest levels of employment rate, after a critical threshold of EMP=POP55%, have a positive eect on
economic growth. This is clearly visible from the horizontal variation of color from red to green in upper portion
of the plot. For lower values of EMP=POP , tness is the most important variables since the dominant variation
of the color is vertical. The higher the tnessm the higher the GDP per capita growth rate.
Fitness and Human Capital
In endogenous growth theories, human capital is an essential ingredient to achieve sustained growth
rates. The accumulation of human capital, through formal training or learning-by-doing, creates pos-
itive externalities through increased productivity and technological innovation originating from the
process [9{11]. In Barro's growth regressions [4, 44] human capital is positively and signicantly re-
lated to subsequent GDP per capita growth rates.
Here human capital is proxied by a measure of educational attainment at each starting period.
Figure 7 puts into light a positive relation between tness and human capital (as conrmed by their
signicant Pearson correlation of 0 :30), principally for intermediate and high tness values. In some
areas of the gure tness and human capital are entangled and reinforce each other, while in others
high initial tness can compensate for a lack of initial human capital.
In fact, low and intermediate tness countries are associated with low human capital ( <2). By

GDP per capita growth rate, where a  t= 5 years is considered. The variation of the growth rate is repre-
sented through color. The color-map is obtained through a non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimation. Life
expectancy values &73 years have a positive eect on growth rates. When life expectancy <73 years, tness
determines the color contour: the higher the tness, the higher the growth rate. However, also high tness
countries show higher growth rate when life expectancy >60 years.
Notably, two main features of the relationships can be highlighted. First, as expected, countries with
very high human capital levels grow slowly, as can be seen in the upper right corner of the gure.
Second, in the bottom right corner are placed countries that, having very high tness, are able to enter
into sustained growth regimes even with low initial human capital levels. In such a way -as can be
appreciated by the vertical passage from red to green, and then back to red- for high and intermediate
tness countries we observe a sort of inverted U-shaped relationship between human capital and the
growth rate. Low initial human capital predicts low growth rate (lower red-yellow area), intermediate
human capital predicts high growth rates (intense green area), and, nally, when human capital is high,
the subsequent growth rates are low (upper orange area), but not as in the rst phase.
Fitness and Total Factor Productivity
According to exogenous growth theories, total factor productivity (TFP) -or the Solow residual- indi-
rectly captures technological improvements. In the neoclassical production function is identied as the
growth of output that cannot be accounted for by the growth of the observed inputs, capital and labour.
In this framework, an increase in total factor productivity should shift upwards the growth rate. Note
that being estimated as a residual in the decomposition of the growth rate, all the measurement errors
in capital and labour will be reected in total factor productivity

4.2 Econometric Analysis
Now we perform a parametric linear regression using as explanatory variables GDP per capita log(GDPpc),
Capital Intensity log(K =EMP), number of employees log(EMP), the inverse of Life Expectancy log(1 =LifeExp),
Secondary Schooling log(School), and Total Factor Productivity log(TFP =GDP). The model is there-

Various drivers of economic growth gure as right-hand-side explanatory variables aecting the
growth rate of GDP per capita, on the left-hand side of the equation. The idea is to add tness to
the drivers and observe whether and to which extent the results change. The results of our analy-
sis are shown in Table 1. The Fitness Rank is highly signicant. The eect of Life Expectancy is
positive and signicant, while the coecient of the GDP per capita is negative. Both results are in
agreement with the literature; in particular, the second one is coherent with the convergence scheme
reported by Barro [51] and Mankiw et. al [45]. The other variables display an unexpected behaviour,
probably attributable to measurament errors (Schooling, TFP), low input substitution (Schooling) or
multicollinearity (number of employees, Schooling, Capital Intensity). We are planning to investigate
further this parametric approach, possibly taking into account also xed eects in the regression model.
5. CONCLUSION
This paper has examined how complex network analysis can be a powerful tool to understand eco-
nomic growth. The traditional literature on economic growth does not fully consider the role of the
underlying capabilities, which are however crucial for the adoption of advanced technologies and for the
introduction of innovations. The Fitness metric used in the paper, which captures the global export
specialization prole of countries, is shown to be a signicant variable for predicting growth. Economic
models of growth that overlook the role of complexity therefore run the risk of being misspecied.

structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more
traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth
theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement
with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in
fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be
either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely
overshadow them.

","1引言（Introduction）
消费对于国民经济发展有着重要的作用。改革开放40余年来，中国经济发展成就举世瞩目，
其中包括居民消费在内的消费活动功不可没。消费活动是经济活动的终点，因为其他经济活动的最
终目的是满足消费需求；消费活动又是经济活动的起点，因为消费能带动经济社会发展[1]。中国著
名经济学家尹世杰曾研究过居民消费结构与生活水平提高的关系[2]；潘文轩曾根据西方收入假说，
得出了中国城乡居民消费存在差异性，政策制定时应根据城乡消费差异来制定的结论[3]。经济增长
反映了各国经济与上年相比增长的幅度以及速度，可以用来衡量一个国家的总体经济发展实力。一
般来说，消费由居民消费和政府消费两部分组成，其中居民消费在消费中占主导作用，因此，研究
居民消费和经济增长的关系具有较大的价值。
2居民消费与经济增长（HouseholdConsumptionandEconomicGrowth）
消费是社会再生产过程中的最终环节，指人们利用社会产品或者社会服务以满足各种需要的过
程，主要包括生产消费和个人消费。其中，生产消费是指在生产过程中对劳动和生产资料的消耗，
个人消费则是个人利用社会产品或者社会服务以满足需要的过程，这种消费对生产力的恢复与促进
意义重大。如果没有特殊说明，后文中提及的消费均是指个人消费。
消费水平能够有效反映社会成员对物质文化需求的满足程度。根据凯恩斯经济理论及边际消费
倾向效应可知，消费水平会受收入水平的影响。收入水平的提高会引起消费水平的提高，但是消费
水平提高的增速会低于收入水平提高的增速，引起消费水平提高的滞后，从而导致需求的减少。
中国经济发展可以分为两个阶段。第一个阶段是计划经济阶段，具体时间是1949年新中国成
立后至1978年改革开放前；第二个阶段是中国特色社会主义市场经济阶段，具体时间是1978年改
革开放后至今。
新中国成立初期，抗日战争及内战结束不久。中国的经济体制在战争时期受到了极大的破坏，
同时大量黄金的流失进一步恶化了经济发展情况。中国政府不得不采取各种措施恢复经济、积累财
富。所实行的低消费经济政策实现了经济的初步发展，为改革开放奠定了经济基础。
1978年，改革开放政策得以实施，对中国的人口红利、政策红利实现了有效利用，通过投资来
引入资本、扩大生产。同时引入了市场经济来逐步取代实行已久的计划经济。此后，消费得以放开，
市场的运作抵消了竞争带来的诸多问题，经济总体呈现良性发展态势。在2008年的金融危机中，
中国经济受到的影响小于欧美国家。
居民消费和经济增长的关系表现在两个方面。
一方面，经济增长对居民消费的推动作用主要表现在两个方面。首先是消费数量的提升。经济
增长可以为居民带来更多收入，而收入的增加会直接促进消费。在宏观经济学领域，专家学者普遍
认为收入是影响消费最重要的因素之一，收入对消费有着至关重要的作用。另一方面是消费质量的
提高。近十年来，中国居民的生活迈出了从小康到富足的关键一步，尤其是在脱贫攻坚完成和乡村
振兴战略实施的背景下，消费质量明显提高。经济的发展会促使企业研发生产更加优质的产品，居
民的消费质量因此提高。
另一方面，居民消费可以直接和间接拉动经济增长。从直接方面来说，马克思的消费理论认为，
消费创作劳动者主体，而劳动力的生产可以带动社会的生产。满足居民本身的消费需求可以带来一
定的经济产值。从间接方面来说，居民的消费需求可以带动其他方面的需求，从而间接促进经济的
发展。比如，居民的消费需求增加时，生产厂商会扩大生产规模，可能在改进生产技术方面增加投
资。这样，居民消费提高拉动投资间接拉动了经济增长。",2022-11-18T16:53:57Z,introduhousehold consumptand economic groh

","3数据与模型（DataandModels）
3.1变量的选择（SelectionofVariables）
本文选取国内生产总值作为经济增长的度量。居民消费水平包括城镇居民消费水平和农村居民
消费水平，通过城乡居民购买产品和劳务的数量和质量反映出来。城镇居民总消费是城镇居民消费
水平与城镇人口的乘积，农村居民总消费是农村居民消费水平与农村人口的乘积，其反映的是城镇
或农村的整个消费市场。本文对城市居民消费和农村居民消费分开讨论，以获得对比。
综上所述，本文选取了五个指标，即国内生产总值、城镇居民消费水平、农村居民消费水平、
城镇居民总消费和农村居民总消费，对其进行一定的处理后，通过计量经济学的方法探索它们之间
的内在联系。
3.2数据的来源和处理（SourceandProcessingofData）
本文选取1978年至2019年的数据作为分析的总样本。之所以没有选取1980年以前的数据，
是因为在改革开放前中国经济比较封闭，与此后的经济运行环境差异巨大。而之所以没有选取已经
公布的2020年与2021年的数据，是因为在这两年间中国经济发展和居民消费水平都受到了新型冠
状病毒疫情的不同程度的影响，不宜作为样本参与分析。因此，我们研究的对象是20世纪八九十
年代和21世纪一二十年代共42年的数据。
国内生产总值原始数据来源于国家统计局，单位是亿元人民币。为了剔除价格因素，我们再使
用国内生产总值指数进行调整，得到变量GDP。城镇居民消费水平和农村居民消费水平原始数据也
来自国家统计局。同样，我们采用相关指数剔除掉价格的影响。每位城镇居民的消费水平记作urc，
每位农村居民的消费水平记作rrc，单位是元人民币。而urc和rrc两个变量乘以每年的城镇居民人
口和农村居民人口即可得到城市居民总消费和农村居民总消费，单位是亿元人民币。其中，城镇居
民总消费记作URC，农村居民总消费记作RRC。
为了消除时间序列数据中的异方差，我们对GDP、URC、RRC进行自然对数变换处理，得到
LGDP、LURC、LRRC三个变量；对urc和rrc进行同样的自然对数变换处理，得到lurc和lrrc两个
变量。本文使用的数据分析软件是EViews7.2。
LGDP随时间的变化趋势如图1所示。由图1可知，LGDP随时间的变化几乎是线性的。

消费超过农村居民总消费，使得表示LURC的折线在表示LRRC的折线之上。
图2LURC和LRRC随时间变化折线图
3.3选用的模型（SelectedModels）
VAR模型，即向量自回归模型，是自回归模型的联立形式，可以用于描述多变量时间序列之间
的变动关系。VAR模型以多方程联立的形式出现，系统内每个方程右边变量相同，然后通过模型中
所有内生当期变量对它们的若干滞后值进行回归，进而估计其动态关系。
VEC模型，即向量误差修正模型，是有约束的VAR模型。VEC模型主要约束变量的长期关系
以满足其协整关系，但是允许其出现短期波动。
4实证分析A（EmpiricalAnalysisA）
这一部分是居民消费水平与经济增长关系的实证分析，所应用到的变量是lurc、lrrc和LGDP，
分别表示城镇居民消费水平、农村居民消费水平和国内生产总值。
